      "talking loudly to each other in languages she never wanted to learn.\n",
      "Acuario was a medical student at the Universidad Veracruzana. He \n",
      "drank at las portales too, but he did it to observe the enemy. Acuario was \n",

      "When Acuario got kicked out of college he took Carla on the road \n",

      "Carmichael really liked her. He could see Acuario’s clay feet between \n",

      "working class hero, a perennial victim, and best of all, a crackpot idealist.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 5\n",
      "“Acuario believed all that hippie stuff,” she said. “You know? That \n",
      "we are the start of a new age. A turning point, and all that. He wanted \n",
      "a new world where everybody could have enough to eat and clothes to \n",

      "He got a great shot of the correo, the messenger kid who’d brought \n",
      "him up. The kid said Carmichael should call him El Tigre, the jaguar. \n",
      "They all had this passion for the nom de guerre, that affordable little \n",
      "touch of glamour. Somebody loaned the kid an M16 for the picture \n",
      "and just before Carmichael pushed the button he puffed up his chest \n",

      "had dry, cracked hands from her years at the sink. When her husband \n",
      "didn’t come home from work one day she started asking questions. She \n",

      "move on.\n",
      "There was a 68-year-old man with little islands of whiskers on his \n",

      "him in the face. It was the kind of thing that went beyond political \n",
      "solutions. What were you going to do when there were 17-year-olds all \n",
      "over the country with five kids? How were you going to feed them all? \n",
      "Where were you going to put them?\n",
      "Easy, he thought. Have a war and kill them all off.\n",
      "Two men came running out of the jungle. They had three or four \n",
      "rifles apiece slung over their shoulders and they carried a bundled army \n",
      "blanket between them like a stretcher. They spread the blanket out in \n",
      "the middle of the camp. Inside were another half dozen rifles and zip-\n",
      "lock bags full of bullets.\n",
      "The rifles were Belgian-made fals. They were clean and efficient-\n",
      "looking, with flared pistol grips and short, straight magazines in front \n",
      "of the trigger guard. On full automatic they could put out ten rounds a \n",
      "second. Carmichael had spent a couple of days in the library back in LA \n",
      "reading up on weapons, from small arms to the Mi-24 Hind helicopter \n",

      "“Lieutenant Ramos.”\n",
      "“Yeah? Who’s he?”\n",
      "The old man stared off at the mountains for a while. “He’s from \n",
      "Mexico.” Meaning Mexico City. “He’s with the fpml. ‘Enlace’ con éste \n",
      "Raul Venceremos.” Liaison. The old man sneered when he said it. The \n",
      "fpml, the Popular Front for a Free Mexico, was the most vocal of the \n",
      "dozen or more rebel groups. Their leader called himself Raul Vencer-\n",
      "emos. The last name meant “we shall be victorious.” It was something \n",
      "Che used to say a lot. Venceremos had brought his love of uniforms \n",
      "with him when he defected from the guardia.\n",
      "“There is a radio station,” the old man said. “Radio Venceremos.”\n",
      "“Si,” Carmichael nodded. “La conozco.” It was still the only reliable \n",
      "information anybody could get out of El Salvador.\n",
      "The old man shrugged. “He calls himself for a radio station. What \n",
      "kind of man is that?”\n",
      "“Abuelo!” Ramos shouted.\n",
      "“Excuse me.”\n",
      "Carmichael watched the old man trade a single-shot .22 for an fal \n",
      "so new the barrel was still sticky with oil. When he came back he was \n",
      "smiling wide enough that Carmichael could see all five of his teeth. \n",
      "“Here is my ‘liaison.’” The old man shook the rifle happily.\n",
      "When the fals were gone Ramos handed out the trade-ins. The kid \n",
      "in the orange pants got the old man’s .22. The barrel was held on with \n",
      "silver duct tape, but the kid strutted up proudly to take it. A gun, any \n",
      "gun, was what made you a real soldier.\n",
      "Carmichael shot another roll of film and went to tell Carla \n",
      "goodbye. He shook her hand and said, “I need to get back with the \n",
      "story.” If he hurried, he could make it back to the farm where he and \n",
      "El Tigre had spent the night before. He didn’t want to get caught in the \n",
      "jungle after dark.\n",
      "“I understand,” Carla said. She was restless again, and Carmichael \n",
      "could tell she was just as happy to see him go. “We want to get the \n",

      "He waved from the edge of the camp and Carla and the old man and \n",
      "some of the others waved back. Faustino stood with his arms folded, \n",
      "like he was posing for a memorial statue in downtown Havana.\n",
      "About ten minutes out of camp, Carmichael couldn’t stand it \n",
      "anymore and sat down to take some notes. There was a fine, rapid trem-\n",
      "bling in his hands. He dug a joint out of his backpack and lit up. With \n",
      "the joint hanging out of the corner of his mouth he covered three pages \n",
      "of yellow legal paper with rough impressions.\n",
      "“Goddamn,” he said. It was good stuff. It was career stuff. It was the \n",
      "kind of stuff that got picked up by ap and upi and the goddamn New \n",
      "York Times. When he got back to Villahermosa he was going to buy \n",
      "himself a couple of drinks.\n",
      "He didn’t hear the planes until they were right overhead.\n",
      "They filled a whole spectrum of sound, from the high whine of their \n",
      "turbines to the roar of their exhaust, the rattling of machine guns some-\n",
      "where in the middle of it. The sound came in waves, pounding at him \n",
      "until it made his ears ring. Orange tracers made dotted lines from the \n",
      "sky to the rebel camp.\n",
      "Between the joint and the suddenness of it his brain had fogged. It \n",
      "took long seconds for the message to get through. The planes were at-\n",
      "tacking Carla’s army.\n",
      "He jumped up and looked around frantically. A ragged white contrail \n",
      "blossomed out of one of the planes. There was a flash on the horizon \n",
      "and a couple of seconds later the ground shook. Finally the sound got \n",
      "to him, a long, shrill scream and then thunder.\n",
      "Carmichael’s best guess was four planes. They moved in spurts across \n",
      "the sky, like toys in the hands of a giant, invisible child, and it was hard \n",
      "to focus on them. He knew what they were, though, Italian sf-260 \n",
      "“Warriors.” The Mexican government had bought a dozen of them \n",
      "with borrowed US money specifically to use against the guerrillas.\n",
      "The ground shook and Carmichael realized he was still standing, \n",
      "exposed, in the middle of the trail. He ducked into the forest, unable to \n",
      "hear the crashing of leaves and branches for the noise of the planes. He \n",
      "huddled behind something that looked like an oak as a squad of rebels \n",
      "came running down the trail, their faces vacant with terror.\n",
      "Somebody screamed. A bullet hit over Carmichael’s head, spattering \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 9\n",
      "him with bark. The exposed white flesh of the tree was a ragged ar-\n",
      "row, pointing at him. Tracers lit the forest like demonic fireflies. He had \n",
      "never realized how powerful a .50 caliber bullet was. They were like \n",
      "small meteors. The ground exploded where they hit.\n",
      "He curled into a ball against the tree trunk, knees bumping his \n",
      "forehead, staring upside down at the shower of twigs and leaves sifting \n",
      "slowly out of the trees. The dope or the fear turned a switch in his head \n",
      "and time went out of whack.\n",
      "The bullets fell around him like slow metal rain. The air turned milky \n",
      "white. A thick fog of dust and humus and wood chips and green, shred-\n",
      "ded leaves hung motionless around him. The planes and the gunfire had \n",
      "all tangled together and sounded like a waterfall.\n",
      "Then the bullets turned to water and ran down his back and pooled \n",
      "in his hair.\n",
      "He sat up. The planes were gone and the pattering in the trees was \n",
      "rain. His legal pad was in one hand, his knapsack in the other. He put \n",
      "the pad away and scrambled to his feet, his bladder suddenly aching so \n",
      "badly that he didn’t care if the planes were coming back.\n",
      "He had to go back to the clearing. There wasn’t really any choice. \n",
      "The story had changed under him and he had to see it through.\n",
      "At first he didn’t think anybody was left alive. The ground smoked \n",
      "from wps, white phosphorus rockets, and the trees were shattered and \n",
      "blackened. The rain turned to steam on the bodies, and the steam had \n",
      "the sharp, acetic acid smell of Carmichael’s darkroom back in LA, but \n",
      "mixed with the smells of cordite and burned meat and wet ash.\n",
      "He didn’t realize how light-headed he was until he staggered and \n",
      "nearly went down. He grabbed at a tree and the bark was still hot to the \n",
      "touch. He breathed through his mouth and swallowed the bile that was \n",
      "trying to come up and got out his camera. His fingers were so stiff it \n",
      "took him two minutes to load a fresh roll of film.\n",
      "He started taking pictures. Most of it was too ugly to be printed, \n",
      "limbs without bodies, jeans soaked purple with blood, faces burnt \n",
      "through to the skull. He shot some of the burns because he knew the \n",
      "government was going to deny using phosphorus and he wanted proof.\n",
      "He got long shots without a lot of gruesome detail. Then he started \n",
      "on the faces, getting the ones that were relatively intact. He was look-\n",
      "ing for Carla or Faustino and instead he found Abuelo, the old man. He \n",
      "10 lewis shiner\n",
      "focused and was about to trip the shutter when the old man opened \n",
      "one eye.\n",
      "Carmichael lowered the camera. The old man was gut shot. There was \n",
      "blood everywhere. His skin had the same dark, waxy look the corpses \n",
      "had. The rain ran like tears off his face. The two of them stared at each \n",
      "other for about ten years, and then the old man shut his eye again.\n",
      "Carmichael put the camera away. Somebody started moaning and \n",
      "then the moan turned into a scream. An entire stack of bodies twitched \n",
      "and shook.\n",
      "I’m in hell, Carmichael thought. One of those bullets hit me and I \n",
      "didn’t even know it, and now I’m dead and in hell.\n",
      "Something crawled out from under the moving stack of bodies. It \n",
      "was Carla. The bodies on top of her had saved her from the rockets, but \n",
      "she’d been shot up pretty badly. Her left foot was a bloody mess that it \n",
      "hurt Carmichael even to look at. How much of the rest of the blood \n",
      "was actually hers he couldn’t say.\n",
      "He took her under the arms and pulled her free. It couldn’t do her \n",
      "any more harm than she was already doing by struggling. She went limp \n",
      "in his hands and he stretched her out on some scraps of tent canvas.\n",
      "“You came back.”\n",
      "Carmichael stood up too fast and nearly passed out again. Faustino was \n",
      "staring at him, pale and shaking, holding himself up by the barrel of his rifle.\n",
      "“Yeah,” Carmichael said. “Are you all right?”\n",
      "“Some scratches,” Faustino said. The right hip of his jeans was charred \n",
      "through and his shirt was in rags. He was losing his hair, Carmichael \n",
      "noticed. It made him look less intimidating, now that his cap was gone. \n",
      "He knelt next to Carla and started doing professional-looking things, \n",
      "rolling back one eyelid, taking the pulse in her neck.\n",
      "“Did anybody else make it?” Carmichael asked.\n",
      "“Some ran away in the forest. We have a rendezvous, in case of some-\n",
      "thing like this. I’ll find them tonight.” He sat up on his heels. “We have \n",
      "to get her out of here. There is a doctor in Ocosingo who is with us. \n",
      "You have to help me carry her there.”\n",
      "“Me?” Carmichael said.\n",
      "The rain trailed off while they improvised a stretcher out of one \n",
      "of the cots. Carmichael wanted to look away while Faustino cut off \n",
      "Carla’s jeans and shirt but he couldn’t seem to do it. She wore stained \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 11\n",
      "cotton panties and a heavy duty 1950s-style brassiere. There were bullet \n",
      "holes in her right arm and her left foot and thigh. Faustino rinsed them \n",
      "and squirted in some Betadine and wrapped them in bandages.\n",
      "There were three others still alive, but none of them could walk. \n",
      "Faustino gave them morphine. “I will call the Red Cross when we get \n",
      "to Ocosingo,” he said. “Maybe they will get here before the guardia.”\n",
      "Faustino cached most of the undamaged weapons in a tree well away \n",
      "from the clearing. He slung three fals on his back and filled a knapsack \n",
      "with cartridges. Carmichael saw him wince when the butt of one of the \n",
      "rifles touched his hip.\n",
      "“Unless you want to carry one...?” Faustino offered. \n",
      "Carmichael shook his head.\n",
      "All the way down the mountain Carmichael asked himself what the \n",
      "hell he was doing. He wanted to believe it was for the story. His nice, \n",
      "spherical, perfect story that had suddenly exploded over the countryside. \n",
      "If he stayed with Carla maybe he could make sense of it again.\n",
      "The truth, he suspected, was that he really hadn’t had a choice. There \n",
      "was simply no way to walk away from Faustino and still be able to feel \n",
      "like a human being.\n",
      "By the time the sun went down he was beyond thinking about any-\n",
      "thing. He couldn’t see and he kept stumbling over rocks and branches \n",
      "in the trail. But none of it bothered Faustino, who kept leading him on \n",
      "by the stretcher handles.\n",
      "They took a rest break a little after dark. Carmichael got two bags of \n",
      "trail mix out of his pack and gave one to Faustino.\n",
      "“What is this?”\n",
      "“Dried fruit and nuts. It’s good.”\n",
      "In a few seconds the bag came back. “Animal food,” Faustino said.\n",
      "Animal? Carmichael thought. Who the fuck are you to call me an \n",
      "animal? He felt his face getting hot. He would have shouted at Faustino \n",
      "but he didn’t have the energy.\n",
      "Carla started to make noises. Her head was right next to where \n",
      "Carmichael sat. “Oil them,” she was saying. “Keep them oiled. You \n",
      "have to...” \n",
      "Carmichael brushed the hair off her forehead, working by touch in \n",
      "the darkness. He couldn’t see her eyes until she opened them and they \n",
      "glistened faintly.\n",
      "12 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Planes...?” she said.\n",
      "“Gone,” Carmichael told her.\n",
      "“How many...left...?”\n",
      "“We don’t know yet. Faustino’s here. Go back to sleep.”\n",
      "Her breathing changed and her eyes disappeared again. Carmichael \n",
      "said, “Is there any morphine?”\n",
      "“No,” Faustino said.\n",
      "“Looked like moonlight,” Carla said. “After the bullets hit.”\n",
      "“Don’t talk,” Faustino told her.\n",
      "“Saw men in the jungle. Mayas. Three of them, looking at me. Only \n",
      "the one in the middle wasn’t Maya. He was Northamerican. Kukulkán. \n",
      "It was Kukulkán. They were burning something in a pot, something \n",
      "sour smelling. They had feathers, green feathers, in their hair...”\n",
      "Right, Carmichael thought. Kukulkán was the Mayan name for \n",
      "Quetzalcoatl, the great white god. He had news for her. There weren’t \n",
      "any more great white gods. They wouldn’t be coming to save her, not \n",
      "this year, not this century.\n",
      "“I was there,” Faustino said. “There weren’t any Indians.  It was a \n",
      "dream. Some kind of vision or something.” Carla didn’t answer.  “She’s \n",
      "asleep,” Faustino said finally.\n",
      "Carmichael said, “I think she’s dying.”\n",
      "“She’s not dying. She meets with Raul Venceremos next week. She \n",
      "will not die.”\n",
      "Carmichael nodded, then realized Faustino couldn’t see him. “Okay,” \n",
      "he said. The trail mix had helped the pain in his stomach, but not the \n",
      "ones in his shoulders and neck. His feet were swollen tight against the \n",
      "sides of his boots and his bare legs and arms itched with mosquito bites. \n",
      "Faustino gave him a drink of water and he felt better for a few seconds. \n",
      "Then he remembered the water would probably give him dysentery \n",
      "and he felt very tired.\n",
      "“Come on,” Faustino said, and he bent to pick up his end of the stretcher.\n",
      "At the bottom of the hill lights came out of nowhere and pinned \n",
      "them where they stood. “Please,” Carmichael said, squinting. He \n",
      "couldn’t cover his face without letting go of the stretcher. “Don’t shoot.” \n",
      "He couldn’t believe he’d come this far, survived so much, only to die \n",
      "this way. “I’m an American.”\n",
      "“Somos todos Americanos,” a voice said.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 13\n",
      "“Northamerican,” Carmichael corrected himself. “Journalist.”\n",
      "“Cálmate,” Faustino said. “They are compas, compañeros, you under-\n",
      "stand? They are with us.”\n",
      "“Oh.” Somebody took the end of the stretcher out of his hands and \n",
      "his arms cramped immediately, snapping the lines of pain all the way \n",
      "back to his shoulder blades.\n",
      "“They will find you a place to sleep,” Faustino said. There was an \n",
      "awkward silence. “We are grateful for your help.”\n",
      "“It was nothing,” Carmichael said.\n",
      "“This is true,” Faustino said. “But if you had not helped it would have \n",
      "been less than nothing.”\n",
      "A  kid led him to a shack on the edge of town. It could have been \n",
      "El Tigre but he never said anything and it was too dark and Carmichael \n",
      "was too tired to be sure.\n",
      "They gave him a hammock. He was pretty sure somebody would be \n",
      "sleeping on the floor so he could use it. At the moment he didn’t care.\n",
      "He woke up once in the middle of the night, sure he’d heard a gun-\n",
      "shot. He listened but there was only the sound of a stranger’s snoring \n",
      "from across the room.\n",
      "Not for you, he told himself. It may have been for somebody, but it \n",
      "wasn’t for you.\n",
      "G\n",

      "firecrackers. \n",
      "It was the third time this week the guardia had opened up on dem-\n",
      "onstrators, nothing but warning shots so far, but the thought of it still \n",
      "made Thomas a little sick. Two days ago one of the kids, running away, \n",
      "had tried to climb the project fence and gotten hung up in the barbed \n",
      "wire on top.\n",
      "His concentration was gone. He rolled away from the computer and \n",

      "Oh Christ, Thomas thought. A tank.\n",
      "His intercom hummed. “Wake up, Thomas,” Sarah said. “The sixties \n",

      "“What the hell are we supposed to do?”\n",
      "“I don’t know about you, but I’m going to lie down behind my desk \n",

      "Thomas kicked the screen out of his window and crawled outside, \n",
      "holding onto his glasses with one hand. Straight ahead was the crum-\n",

      "To his right were the front gates and the guardia.\n",

      "it the tank looked like a bloody-jawed Tyrannosaur.\n",
      "Thomas guessed there were fifty soldiers. They would outnumber the \n",

      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 15\n",
      "The humidity glued his shirt to his back and bunched up his underwear \n",

      "Every so often the doors would open and another two or three people \n",
      "would straggle in from the back woods, soldiers behind them to shove \n",

      "wore odd clothes. Geisler was project secretary, which meant he greased \n",

      "shook his head. “Stay close. We have to put up a united front on this \n",

      "Thomas wandered off, found a chair and sat down. A guardia officer \n",
      "came in and stood for a while with his hands behind his back. He was \n",
      "bareheaded and his uniform hung loosely off his shoulders. He looked \n",
      "about sixty. His hair was black and his skin reddish brown, a stigma of \n",
      "Indian blood. He was a captain and Thomas suspected he wouldn’t go \n",
      "much further. European ancestry was still the thing. Thomas had seen \n",
      "him out here before, asking questions, pounding his fist into his left \n",
      "hand. His name was Espinosa.\n",
      "“This is everyone?” he asked. Sarah, out of breath, came to stand next \n",
      "to Thomas’s chair. Everybody else got more or less into a line facing \n",
      "Espinosa.\n",
      "“I thought you were cowering behind your desk,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“They dragged me out,” she said. “The fascists.”\n",
      "Espinosa walked slowly down the line. He pointed to Shapiro and \n",
      "Geisler and finally to Thomas. “You three will stay here.” His English \n",
      "was accented but plain enough. “The rest of you will go back to the \n",
      "United States, to your homes and families. You will be searched and \n",
      "your belongings will be searched but you will not be harmed. We will \n",
      "bring a bus to take you back to Mexico City where you will take an \n",
      "airplane.”\n",
      "“Why you?” Sarah asked.\n",
      "“Seniority, I guess.” Shapiro and Geisler had been here three years, \n",
      "since the beginning. Outside of Thomas and the clerical staff, like Sarah, \n",
      "everybody else was pretty recent.\n",
      "Thomas stood up and Sarah put her arms around him. She was \n",
      "crying. “I don’t want to go,” she said. “There’s going to be concrete \n",

      "It took half an hour to get the room cleared. Thomas was \n",

      "to take care of the compost, who was going to check the pH in the fish \n",
      "tanks? What about aphids, what about nitrogen shortfalls?\n",
      "One of the grad students, a thin girl from ucla, tried to get loose. \n",

      "But then, he thought, if they tried to drag me out maybe I’d be fight-\n",

      "of being off the power grid, politically and ecologically.\n",
      "Espinosa kept three soldiers behind with him. They were just kids, \n",
      "Thomas thought. The older ones would be fighting in the eastern \n",
      "jungles or the streets of Juarez and Zihautenejo.\n",
      "“I want you to show me the weapons,” Espinosa said.\n",
      "Shapiro let out a theatrical sigh. “Is that all? The weapons business \n",
      "again? We haven’t got any. How many times do we have to tell you?”\n",
      "“It is known that you are supporting the rebels. We know this, you \n",
      "see. The rebels line up outside the gate. We don’t look for the guns or \n",
      "the mortars. We look for the nerve gas. The virus.”\n",
      "“For God’s sake,” Shapiro said. “Those kids outside were protesters. \n",
      "They want us out of here as much as you do. In spite of the fact that \n",
      "your government asked us here in the first place.”\n",
      "“I am not playing with games, here,” Espinosa said. “The rebels must \n",
      "be stopped. They are fighting against legal elected candidates. They are \n",
      "breaking the law.”\n",
      "It was a bad year for the Institutional Revolution. The pri had been \n",

      "until they came out the way they were supposed to.\n",
      "The pri had tried that in Zihuatenejo and Juarez after the July 6 \n",
      "elections and people had started turning over cars and lighting matches. \n",
      "Half of Zihua had burned to the ground before the guardia shot enough \n",
      "people to quiet things down. There were still crowds of people holding \n",
      "the bridge between Juarez and El Paso.\n",
      "“Okay, we hear you making all the right noises,” Shapiro said. “What \n",
      "is it you want? ¿La mordida?”\n",
      "Thomas flinched. There was plenty of corruption in Mexico, but a \n",
      "certain style was expected. One didn’t haggle over bribes in public.\n",
      "“No lady, I don’t want you money. I want to see the things you have \n",

      "Two dozen soldiers searched the staff cottages. Thomas could \n",

      "with bayonets to make their position clear.\n",
      "Thomas felt sorry for Espinosa. What was the old man supposed to \n",

      "oil rigs? Five and six foot high columnar fish tanks with giant water lil-\n",
      "ies floating on top? The glass walls and aquaria on the south sides of all \n",
      "the bungalows?\n",
      "The worst was the solar wall, troughs of hyacinths inside a long, \n",
      "louvered greenhouse. It ran straight out from the main building to the \n",
      "fountain where the guardia had parked their tank. The project’s sewage \n",
      "ran through troughs to get rid of the organics, then out to the fountain \n",
      "and a series of sand filters to clean and aerate it. But the greenhouse \n",
      "itself stank of shit.\n",
      "Espinosa hesitated at the door, wrinkling his face.\n",
      "“I’m with you,” Thomas said. “But these folks don’t seem to mind the \n",
      "smell of their own shit. All part of living in harmony with the planet.”\n",
      "“Fuck you, Thomas,” Shapiro said.\n",
      "“‘These people?’” Espinosa said. “Are you not one of them?”\n",
      "“That’s something Thomas was never good at,” Shapiro said. “Making \n",
      "up his mind. Committing himself.”\n",
      "“Could we maybe have a little less dissension in the ranks?” Geisler asked.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 19\n",

      "“Oh Christ. Go ahead. Make yourself at home.”\n",
      "“You,” Espinosa said, looking at Thomas. “You come with.”\n",
      "They went in. Thomas breathed through his mouth. He felt like he \n",
      "was getting shit on his tongue and gums. Espinosa made out that it \n",
      "didn’t bother him, poking at the rubbery plants, bending over to check \n",
      "the undersides of the bracing under the troughs.\n",
      "“There aren’t any weapons,” Thomas said. His glasses had misted from \n",
      "the humidity and he wiped them on his shirttail.\n",
      "“I want to believe you,” Espinosa said. He rolled up one sleeve and \n",
      "felt around in the murky water. “Maybe I do believe you. But I don’t \n",
      "trust you.” There was a certain dry humor in the slant of his eyebrows. \n",
      "“You understand?”\n",
      "“Los requisitos,” Thomas said. Formalities.\n",
      "“Claro que sí.” Espinosa dried his arm thoroughly with a hand-\n",
      "kerchief and then dropped the handkerchief on the floor. It was like \n",
      "they had sealed some kind of bargain, though Thomas wasn’t sure \n",
      "what it involved.\n",
      "They went back outside. A soldier came running up with a three-\n",
      "foot marijuana plant, dirt still crumbling off its roots. “Mire, capitan! \n",
      "Marijuana!”\n",
      "“It’s not ours,” Shapiro said. “Goddammit, I told everybody no dope!” \n",
      "Thomas found her histrionics nearly convincing.\n",
      "Espinosa told the soldier in Spanish, “Go talk to the sergeant. See if \n",
      "he’s found any drugs in the rooms.” Then he looked at Shapiro. “You \n",
      "could go to jail for this, all of you. Smuggling the drugs and helping the \n",
      "rebels.”\n",
      "“I already told you—”\n",
      "Geisler put a hand on her arm. “Judy, take it easy....”\n",
      "Espinosa wasn’t bluffing. The plant was more than enough to get \n",
      "them into jail. And if their paperwork got lost and they spent months or \n",
      "years there, even died there, well, it had happened before.\n",
      "Thomas’s skin felt clammy. “Look,” he said. “We’re trying to cooper-\n",
      "ate. We didn’t know about the marijuana.” He was lying, of course. The \n",
      "a&m gang was famous for their killer hybrid pot. If Espinosa tried to \n",
      "burn the plants he would stone all of Cuernavaca.\n",
      "20 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Sargento!” Espinosa shouted. The sergeant came running back, knees \n",
      "high, British army style. “Lock them up,” he said in English, then re-\n",
      "peated it in Spanish.\n",
      "The sergeant looked confused. “Where, sir?” he asked in Spanish. \n",
      "“Everything is glass.”\n",
      "“Think of something,” Espinosa said.\n",
      "The sergeant shut them in the kitchen. One door led into the \n",
      "mural room and the rest of the main building, and the other door led \n",
      "out to the pool. Espinosa put guards on both of them. “It was time for \n",
      "supper anyway,” Thomas said. He made himself an avocado sandwich \n",
      "and sat down at the long, grease-soaked table.\n",
      "Shapiro ranted for ten or fifteen minutes about how none of this \n",
      "could be happening. Finally she got hungry too and Thomas made \n",
      "some more sandwiches.\n",
      "Thomas hadn’t worn a watch in over a year, but he’d gotten sensi-\n",
      "tive to the cycles of daylight. Close to sunset the goats and chickens and \n",
      "parrots got restless and let out more than their usual amount of noise. \n",
      "He made it to be about eight o’clock when they heard the tank start up \n",
      "and drive away. A few minutes later Espinosa came in. He was slumping \n",
      "a bit, looking his age.\n",
      "“You can sleep in you same places tonight. There will be guards at the \n",
      "doors.”\n",
      "“You want something to eat?” Thomas said. “We’ll just have to throw \n",
      "it out if you don’t.”\n",
      "Espinosa looked uncomfortable. “We meet here tomorrow morning. \n",
      "Seven o’clock.” He turned and walked out again.\n",
      "None of the cottages had locks. Thomas waited until dark to \n",
      "open his door and look outside. There were two guards, neither one \n",
      "over 18. They started to raise their guns, then saw the bottles in his \n",
      "hands. He gave them each a beer and asked in Spanish if he could sit by \n",
      "the pool for a couple of minutes. It was only a few yards away.\n",
      "“If you try to run,” one of them apologized, “we’ll have to shoot you.”\n",
      "“Claro,” Thomas said.\n",
      "When they saw he didn’t want any more than to sit by the water they \n",
      "faded into the darkness and left him alone.\n",
      "The pool was gigantic, the largest Thomas had ever seen. It was the \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 21\n",
      "center of the project, not just physically but metaphorically. The project \n",
      "was a model of the world, and the pool was its ocean. It was stocked with \n",
      "mirror carp, who made imitation tides when they thrashed their tails. It \n",
      "had tilapia instead of whales to eat the algae and clean the water. White \n",
      "amurs ate the bigger plants and the project ate the amurs and the talapia.\n",
      "Thomas was far enough into the metaphor that listening to the patter \n",
      "of the murky water against the tiles had become like listening to real \n",
      "waves. It cleared his head, relaxed him.\n",
      "Eventually he noticed an orange glow off to his right, on the hotel \n",
      "side of the shallow end. About the same time he smelled the smoke \n",
      "from the cigarette. It had been so long since Thomas had actually seen \n",
      "anybody smoking tobacco that he was a little horrified.\n",
      "“I think,” Espinosa said at last, “my men have not much discipline.”\n",
      "“They trusted me,” Thomas said. “Don’t blame them for that.”\n",
      "“You are believers in trust, you Northamericans. True?”\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "“Tell me about you boats.”\n",
      "“You mean the ocean arks?” The ark was anchored in the deep end. \n",
      "Thomas could hear it scraping gently against the edges of the pool. It \n",
      "was a hell of a design, strong, light, simple, made of balsa wood and ep-\n",
      "oxy. It was twice as fast as the gasoline-powered boats it replaced, silent, \n",
      "needed no fuel or engine repairs.\n",
      "“They use them on the south coast now, true?”\n",
      "“There’s two of them in Zihuatenejo. The people down there love \n",
      "them. They’re catching twice the fish they used to.”\n",
      "“No,” Espinosa said. “The rebels have you boats now. One is sunk. \n",
      "The other they sail around in the bay. It is a weapon now, you see?”\n",
      "Stupid bastards, Thomas thought. They’d sunk a boat that could have \n",
      "fed hundreds of people for the rest of their lives. For politics.\n",
      "“You trust too much,” Espinosa said. “You trust the money and the \n",
      "tools and you think people are stupid that don’t speak English as good \n",
      "as you.”\n",
      "“No,” Thomas said. “Maybe I used to think like that, before I came \n",
      "here. But people can change. People can learn. That’s what this place is \n",
      "all about.”\n",
      "“I would like to believe you.” The orange light of the cigarette flew \n",
      "out over the pool and sizzled into the water. Thomas heard a second \n",
      "splash as a carp struck at it. “But I don’t trust you.”\n",
      "22 lewis shiner\n",
      "•\n",
      "Thomas went back to his room. The guards, who must have heard \n",
      "Espinosa complaining, looked nervous as he shut them out. He stuck a \n",
      "doorstop in the frame to wedge the door closed.\n",
      "He didn’t want to think about Espinosa anymore. He spread out \n",
      "Lindsey’s letter on the bed next to him and tried to decipher it. She had \n",
      "signed it “love”—that had to count for something.\n",
      "What he wanted to believe was that she’d developed, after all these \n",
      "years, a physical passion for him that she could no longer deny. None \n",
      "of the other men she’d had, and God knew there had been enough of \n",
      "them, had worked out. Now Thomas would get his shot.\n",
      "She was his brother’s wife, which had always been a problem. \n",
      "Even though his brother was legally dead, had disappeared from the \n",
      "Timberlawn Psychiatric Hospital in Dallas back in 1978 and hadn’t been \n",
      "heard from since. In those eight years he’d seen Lindsey maybe twice, \n",
      "written to her a couple of times a year.\n",
      "But he hadn’t forgotten her. The first time he’d ever seen her was \n",
      "backstage after one of Eddie’s concerts. It would have been in the early \n",
      "seventies sometime. She was hanging all over Eddie. She had on a thin \n",
      "white tank top and no bra, leather jeans, eyeliner all the way around her \n",
      "eyes, boots with three-inch heels and zippers. A cigarette hung out of \n",
      "her mouth, the smoke not as strong as her perfume. Her hands rattled \n",
      "with too many rings and her hair was brittle from bleach.\n",
      "He was still used to thinking of Eddie as a little kid, but seeing Lind-\n",
      "sey changed all that. Her image was primal. A little kid wouldn’t have \n",
      "been able to live up to her.\n",
      "It was bullshit, of course. Under the blatant sexual propaganda she \n",
      "was like anybody else. She watched soap operas and read Cosmo and ate \n",
      "canned peach halves wrapped in a slice of Wonder Bread. But Thomas had \n",
      "imprinted her as some kind of bush league sex goddess, the way ducks \n",
      "imprint their mothers, and his left-brain logic had no power over her.\n",
      "He remembered the letter she’d written him back in the spring of ‘77. \n",
      "Eddie had checked himself into Timberlawn, and she’d come to Dal-\n",
      "las to sign the papers. There was perfume on the letter and it said how \n",
      "much she appreciated the way Thomas had always been there for her. So \n",
      "he drove the two hundred miles to Dallas in a white heat and ended up \n",
      "sleeping on the couch. She couldn’t bring herself, she said, to do that to \n",
      "Eddie. Not yet. She hugged him but wouldn’t kiss him. He’d woken up \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 23\n",
      "again and again, all night long, thinking every noise was Lindsey com-\n",
      "ing to him to tell him she’d changed her mind, to lead him back to her \n",
      "fragrant bed.\n",
      "Thinking about her, even now, made his dick hard as a piece of lum-\n",
      "ber. He pulled musty-smelling drapes over the fish tanks built into the \n",
      "south wall. “This could get ugly,” he told the fish. “You wouldn’t want \n",
      "to see it.” He masturbated, picturing Lindsey stretched out on her back, \n",
      "arms reaching up for him, breasts flattened a little toward the sides, eyes \n",
      "a little crossed. Kid stuff. Then he drank a beer and took a shower and \n",
      "went to sleep.\n",
      "Espinosa met them in the kitchen for breakfast, huevos motuleños. \n",
      "“This is good food,” he said. “Very rich.”\n",
      "“Thanks,” Shapiro said. “Since you sent our dishwashers home yester-\n",

      "“Forget the dishes,” Espinosa said. He looked at Thomas. “Today I \n",
      "want to see what you do with the computer.”\n",
      "“Today,” Shapiro said, “is Thomas’s day in the gardens. There’s nobody \n",
      "to trade out with him.”\n",
      "“Tomorrow,” Espinosa said, “maybe there are no gardens. Today I look \n",
      "at the computer.”\n",
      "“Suit yourself,” Thomas said. He put his dishes and Espinosa’s in a \n",
      "sink full of water. They went to his office and Thomas turned on his pc. \n",
      "“You want to see my stuff or the project stuff?” He was networked to \n",
      "the project database and could call in any of the monitor programs.\n",
      "“You,” Espinosa said.\n",
      "Thomas logged on and called up his mapping program. He was sud-\n",
      "denly conscious of his open window, of the screen lying out on the \n",
      "lawn where he’d kicked it. Espinosa didn’t say anything about it so \n",
      "neither did he. But the memory of the tank, the rifles, the men pawing \n",
      "through the cottages, was a physical presence in the room.\n",
      "A graph scrolled down the crt. It looked a little like a topographic \n",
      "map, the various regions shaded with dots, brackets, plus signs, asterisks, \n",
      "and rectangles. “This is a trend surface analysis of Mayan sites,” Thomas \n",
      "said. It came out fast and harsh. “It’s a kind of regression analysis, using \n",
      "the region as a response surface.”\n",
      "“Trend...surface...analysis,” Espinosa said. He looked like someone was \n",
      "explaining to him why his children were dead. Sad, frightened, unable to \n",
      "24 lewis shiner\n",
      "understand. Thomas suddenly saw the deliberate sadism in what he was \n",

      "alien as he could make them. He swiveled around in his chair.\n",
      "“Look,” he said. “I understand your position. You don’t want to be \n",
      "here. The government’s scared, you’re scared, you’re grabbing at straws. \n",
      "Es decir, asirse de un pelo, okay?”\n",
      "“Talk English. I understand you.”\n",
      "“Maybe you’re afraid of this place. Because you don’t understand \n",
      "what’s going on here. But there’s no big mystery. I can show you how to \n",
      "use a computer this afternoon.”\n",
      "“My son, he uses the computers at the University City. We don’t \n",
      "afraid of computers.”\n",
      "“Okay, fine. But what I’m saying is, this isn’t what you’re looking for. \n",
      "This is ancient history. This is about the Mayan collapse, a thousand \n",
      "years ago. It shows when the cities died out. We’re still trying to figure \n",
      "out why it happened.”\n",
      "“Maybe they had rebels,” Espinosa said.\n",
      "“Maybe they did.” It was, in fact, one of the models he was testing, \n",
      "and consistent with Prigogene’s work.\n",
      "“The dark areas, they are the most recent?”\n",
      "“Kind of,” Thomas said. “It’s showing a lot of different things at once. \n",
      "Population, economy, what the land is like, government.”\n",
      "Espinosa was nodding. “My son is study the what you call it. Science \n",
      "of politics.”\n",
      "“Probably a real good idea,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“Why are you so interest in the Maya? For something that happens a \n",
      "thousand years ago?” \n",
      "“There’s a Mayan ruin called Na Chan. I did my dissertation there. It \n",
      "was a book, The Lords of the Forest.”\n",
      "“Ah yes. The mushroom book. Last night I read you, what you call, \n",
      "file folder.” \n",
      "Wonderful, Thomas thought. Here we go again. The book was a seri-\n",
      "ous attempt to reconstruct the culture of the area. Part of that culture \n",
      "was a mushroom that allowed a shaman to see backward in time. At least \n",
      "that was what they seemed to believe. Thomas had taken endless grief \n",
      "from his professors for even mentioning it. The people at Mentor books \n",
      "loved it and wanted him to beef it up. He could be the next Castaneda, \n",
      "they said. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 25\n",
      "Espinosa, to his relief, let it go. “You fly the helicopter,” he said. \n",
      "“That’s right.” \n",
      "“Where you learn to do this? Vietnam?” \n",
      "“No,” Thomas said. “I didn’t go.” \n",
      "“Why not?” \n",
      "“I was in school.” \n",
      "“But you learn anyway.” \n",
      "“We used a helicopter to get in and out of Na Chan. The pilot \n",
      "taught me.” \n",
      "“This is not something you learn in two-three days. You must have \n",

      "hard to explain,” he said. “It’s like...I know we shouldn’t have been in \n",
      "Vietnam. But I still feel like I missed something. Something important.” \n",
      "“Maybe now you have a Vietnam here, no? Maybe you still get you \n",
      "chance.”\n",
      "One of the soldiers knocked on the open door and came in. “There \n",
      "is a woman,” he said to Espinosa in Spanish. “A gringa, blonde. Looking \n",
      "for him.” He tilted his head toward Thomas.\n",
      "“Lindsey,” Thomas said, his throat closing up on him. “Se llama Lindsey.”\n",
      "The soldier looked at him. “Si, verdad.”\n",
      "“Okay,” Espinosa said. “Search her. But be careful with your hands, \n",
      "you understand me? And bring her to me.”\n",
      "Thomas got up, sat back down again. Espinosa watched him. It’s the \n",
      "first weakness any of us have let him see, Thomas thought. We’ve been \n",
      "holed up here like some kind of pale foreign gods, doling out favors and \n",
      "expecting to be loved in return. No wonder they resent us.\n",
      "“She is you girlfriend?” Espinosa asked gently.\n",
      "“No,” Thomas said. “Just...she’s just a friend.”\n",
      "“Si, claro,” Espinosa said. “Of course.” It was the way he might have \n",
      "smiled at his son, at the University in Mexico City.\n",
      "The guard brought her in and Thomas stood up again.\n",
      "“Nothing, sir,” the guard said in Spanish and Espinosa nodded \n",
      "him away.\n",
      "Her hair was darker, not quite brown, and some of the long strands \n",
      "had gone white. She still wore eye makeup but the eyes looked softer, \n",
      "26 lewis shiner\n",
      "set in a web of fine lines like the ones that had come up at the corners \n",
      "of her mouth. No other makeup except a little pale lipstick. Nothing to \n",
      "hide anymore. She wore a simple knit dress, navy blue, loose enough to \n",
      "fit local standards of modesty. Flat shoes, no jewelry.\n",
      "Except her wedding ring.\n",
      "“You look wonderful,” Thomas said. “I can’t believe how good you \n",
      "look.”\n",
      "“You too,” Lindsey said. She had trouble meeting his eyes. She held \n",
      "on to her bare upper arms, forearms crossed over her chest. Thomas \n",
      "saw she wasn’t going to hug him. The rest of his fantasies crumbled and \n",
      "blew away like fairy dust.\n",
      "Your whole life has been like this, he told himself. You’ve been sitting \n",
      "around waiting for someone or some idea to come along and sweep \n",
      "you off your feet. How much longer are you going to wait?\n",
      "He offered her his chair and she settled cautiously, tugging on the \n",
      "hem of her dress, fiddling with her purse. Finally she looked at Espinosa \n",
      "and then at Thomas. “What in God’s name is going on here?”\n",
      "Thomas shrugged. “Up until yesterday we were trying to save the \n",
      "world. New energy sources, new food supplies, new shelters, the whole \n",
      "bit. Now it looks like the world is not interested in being saved.” He \n",
      "wanted a reaction from Espinosa but he didn’t get one.\n",
      "“Are you, like, under arrest or something?”\n",
      "“I don’t know. Dígame, Capitán Espinosa, am I under arrest?”\n",
      "“Not officially. Not right now.”\n",
      "“Can I talk to him?” Lindsey asked Espinosa. “I mean, in private? \n",
      "It’s...it’s a personal matter.”\n",
      "“Ah,” Espinosa said. He put his hand around his chin and looked \n",
      "away. After a few seconds he said, “We go outside. You sit and talk, far \n",
      "enough away we don’t hear you, but we can see everything.”\n",
      "“So I don’t give her any microfilm.”\n",
      "“No film, no virus, no nerve gas.” Thomas could no longer tell \n",
      "whether he was kidding or not.\n",
      "“I have to show him a picture,” Lindsey said. “Is that okay?”\n",
      "“Show to me.”\n",
      "Lindsey passed him a three by five black and white print. Espinosa \n",
      "looked at it very hard for a few seconds, then turned it over a couple of \n",
      "times. He shrugged and handed it to Thomas.\n",
      "It showed three Mayans in robes, laughing and smoking dark conical \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 27\n",
      "cigars. A fourth man, with equally long hair and the same kind of cot-\n",
      "ton robe, looked like he was trying to get out of the picture.\n",
      "The fourth man was his brother Eddie.\n",
      "They sat on folding chairs by the pool. Thomas shifted from side to \n",
      "side, listening to the sand crunch under the runners of the chair. “Do \n",
      "you want to talk about it or not?” Lindsey asked.\n",
      "“Sure,” Thomas said. “Where did you get the picture?”\n",
      "“Some kid reporter took it. He’s on assignment for Rolling Stone, \n",
      "trying to get an interview with the rebels. He did a feature on the \n",
      "Lacandones while he was waiting. His editor knew Eddie in the \n",
      "seventies and recognized him.”\n",
      "“So now what happens?”\n",
      "“So now I go up there and look for him. What else?”\n",
      "Thomas shrugged.\n",
      "“What the hell’s wrong with you?” Lindsey said. “If this is Eddie then \n",
      "it means he’s okay! He’s alive! He’s your brother for Christ’s sake! Don’t \n",
      "you care?”\n",
      "“I care,” Thomas said. “Maybe I care more than you do. I care enough \n",
      "to leave him the hell alone if he wants. Look, even if I could get away \n",
      "from here, even if we could talk Espinosa into letting me go, who says \n",
      "Eddie even wants to be found?”\n",
      "“Maybe he has amnesia.”\n",
      "“Amnesia. Shit. Maybe it’s not Eddie at all, maybe it’s his evil twin. \n",
      "You watch too much tv.”\n",
      "“What do you want me to do, just forget about him?”\n",
      "“That’s exactly what you should do. The entire country is coming \n",
      "down around our ears. Those mountains are full of rebels and the guar-\n",
      "dia is going nuts trying to find them. If you get caught up in that you’re \n",
      "going to need somebody to rescue you.”\n",
      "“That’s why I want you to come with me.”\n",
      "“You’re chasing the past. Eddie chucked it all ten years ago. He cut \n",
      "his records and said what he had to say and got out. He’s finished. He’s \n",
      "retired. If he wants to play Indian for the rest of his life, he’s entitled.”\n",
      "“What about you? Are you retired too?”\n",
      "Thomas remembered the look on Espinosa’s face when he talked \n",
      "about his kid. For the first time he saw through to something that he \n",
      "doubted Geisler and Shapiro had ever seen. Espinosa’s kid, the son of a \n",
      "28 lewis shiner\n",
      "career military man in a third world country, plugging away on his crt. \n",
      "If that wasn’t the future, he didn’t know what was.\n",
      "“No,” he said. “Maybe I’ve been standing around here for a couple of \n",
      "years with my thumb up my ass, but I don’t think I’ve given up. There’s \n",
      "still work to be done. Changing people’s heads, people like Espinosa. \n",
      "Stopping shit like Chernobyl and Bhopal before we kill off the whole \n",
      "planet.”\n",
      "She shook her head. “You tell me I’m living in the past, and then you \n",
      "start up with all this Woodstock Generation crap. You’re not going to \n",
      "change anything hiding out down here.”\n",
      "“Who’s hiding out?” Thomas said. “They’re right up against the fu-\n",
      "ture every day here. They’ve got close to a thousand sensors all over the \n",
      "complex, feeding a central computer. They’ve got plans to retrofit entire \n",
      "cities with solar technology, to teach poor villages how to build boats \n",
      "like that one there—”\n",
      "“Listen to you. You keep saying ‘they.’ I hear everything you’re saying \n",
      "but I don’t buy it. I think you’re kidding yourself. People aren’t going to \n",
      "tear down all their beautiful ranch style homes and start living in green-\n",
      "houses. Things are going to go on the way they always have.”\n",
      "Thomas looked down at his sneakers, tapping the sides together. “You \n",
      "know what they say about me here? They say I’m sanpaku. It’s Japanese \n",
      "or something. It means I show too much white along the bottoms of \n",
      "my eyes. It’s supposed to mean I’m out of balance or something. Well \n",
      "maybe I am. I’m 38 years old. I’m divorced, no kids, no house, no car, \n",
      "no pension. It’s time for me to start believing in something.”\n",
      "“Thomas...”\n",
      "“No,” he said. “Maybe we can’t change everything overnight. But \n",
      "we can get started. A little at a time. Retrofitting, rebuilding. When the \n",
      "ranch houses fall down we can put up something better. Even getting \n",
      "the information out there would be something.” Finally he looked up at \n",
      "her. “It would be something.”\n",
      "They both got up. She put out her hand and Thomas took it, wanting \n",
      "to wrap her in his arms, knowing he could do it if he wanted to, know-\n",
      "ing he wasn’t strong enough to deal with it if he did.\n",
      "“I’m at the Hotel Capitol,” she said. “Calle Uruguay, near the \n",
      "Alameda. If you change your mind.”\n",
      "She stopped once by the far side of the pool and looked back. \n",
      "Thomas sat down and stared into the water and finally she went away.\n",

      "•\n",
      "Espinosa sat in the chair next to him, the one where Lindsey \n",
      "had been sitting. “She want you to leave with her?”\n",
      "“Yeah,” Thomas said. “That’s what she wanted.” \n",
      "“She is a very beautiful woman. Very handsome.”\n",
      "Thomas nodded. He picked up a thumb-sized chunk of cement and \n",
      "tossed it at the nearest carp. The water killed its momentum. It drifted \n",
      "slowly past the nose of the fish, who had backed up two inches to \n",
      "watch it. Fuck you too, Thomas thought.\n",
      "“I could let you go,” Espinosa said. “To go with her. You don’t need \n",
      "to be here.”\n",
      "“That’s not the point,” Thomas said. He saw that Espinosa meant it, \n",
      "and the kindness made him uncomfortable.\n",
      "“Then what is the point?”\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“We close you down,” Espinosa said. They were in the mural \n",
      "room again. Espinosa had brought two of his men along, but their rifles \n",
      "were slung over their shoulders, out of the way. “For two weeks. Then \n",
      "you open again.”\n",
      "“Two weeks?” Shapiro said. \n",
      "“What about our people?” Geisler asked. “Do we get our people \n",
      "back?” \n",
      "Espinosa shook his head. “The Republic will be you partner now. We \n",
      "bring in people to help you.” \n",
      "“Great,” Shapiro said. “We’ve been fucking nationalized.” \n",
      "“What people?” Geisler asked. “The Army?” \n",
      "“No. I think maybe my son like to work here. He can bring others \n",
      "from the University City to help him.” \n",
      "“Your son?” Shapiro said. “What kind of bullshit stunt—” \n",
      "“Judy,” Thomas said, “just shut up for once.” He nodded to Espinosa. “I \n",

      "“Thomas...” Shapiro said. \n",
      "“That is all,” Espinosa said. “You may stay here in Cuernavaca or go \n",
      "back to Mexico City.” He walked over to where Thomas was sprawled \n",
      "in one of the plastic chairs. \n",
      "“Two weeks,” he said quietly. “Long enough to do what you have to \n",
      "and come back.” \n",
      "30 lewis shiner\n",
      "“And if I don’t want to go?” Thomas said. \n",

      "W\n",
      "hen Eddie got to the godhouse he still had to wait outside \n",
      "for the old man to notice him. Chan Ma’ax sat and mashed yel-\n",
      "low pine gum into pom for the incense pots and pretended Eddie wasn’t \n",
      "there. Eddie was sweating and his nerves were bad, but the old man \n",
      "demanded patience.\n",
      "In their time the Mayans had worked out the cycles of the planets \n",
      "and built stone temples so graceful they made Eddie’s eyes burn. And \n",
      "nothing survived but a dozen wood poles and a thatched roof, and a \n",
      "wrinkled old man sitting cross-legged on a mat.\n",
      "A tractor coughed in the distance, then crashed screaming into the \n",
      "underbrush. Behind the godhouse the logging road split the dense \n",
      "green of the jungle, its orange ruts filmed over with standing water. To \n",
      "either side the pale ovals of mahogany stumps stared back like fright-\n",
      "ened eyes.\n",
      "The air was thick and smelled of cookfires and diesel. It congealed on \n",
      "Eddie’s face and neck; if he tried to rub his hands together they would \n",
      "stick from the humidity.\n",
      "“Oken,” the old man said at last. “Come in, Eddie.”\n",
      "Eddie hiked up his tunic and sat on a low mahogany stool. After \n",
      "a couple of minutes the old man said, “Ma’ax Garcia spent two days \n",
      "in the forest, looking for copal to burn in the godpots. Nothing.” He \n",
      "spread his hands, palm down, then turned them over and pretended to \n",
      "search them for copal. He spoke in Mayan, but slowly, so Eddie could \n",
      "follow. Eddie smiled and nodded to show he understood.\n",
      "The Ma’ax Garcia he was talking about was Eddie’s age, mid-thirties. \n",
      "He was Chan Ma’ax’s oldest son by his second wife. He loved the old \n",
      "man and wore himself out trying to help him.\n",
      "“They took all the mahogany,” Chan Ma’ax said. “So now we can’t \n",
      "even make new canoes. I guess now we have to take that one and start \n",
      "using it on the lake.” He pointed to the ceremonial canoe full of sugar \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 31\n",
      "cane pulp, white bark, and water. It had been fermenting under a cover-\n",
      "ing of palm leaves since the day before. “So what then? No more balché? \n",
      "Then it will truly be the end of the world. My sons will all turn into \n",
      "evangelistas, no?”\n",
      "He laughed, showing brown stubs of teeth. His name meant “little \n",
      "monkey” after his clan, and over the years he’d started to look like one: \n",
      "flat nose, hunched back, matted hair. The first time Eddie had been \n",
      "introduced to him as the t’o’ohil, the “great one,” he’d assumed it was \n",
      "another joke.\n",
      "That had been a long time ago. Now, even when the old man was \n",
      "clowning around, it scared the living daylights out of him.\n",
      "In his more lucid moments Eddie saw himself as a victim of a \n",
      "fashionable malaise, the leading edge of a fin-de-millennium craziness \n",
      "that would peak in another 15 years. The rest of the time it seemed like \n",
      "some kind of short circuit in his talent that had made him walk out on \n",
      "a career that was only getting started. But it had gotten to the point \n",
      "where everything sounded stale, where he’d go blank on stage and play \n",
      "obvious shit with no energy or heart. And then late at night he’d hear \n",
      "things in his head that were more feeling than music, things he could \n",
      "never find on the neck of a guitar.\n",
      "So he’d done a stretch in a private sanitarium, and when he decided \n",
      "it wasn’t helping, he walked away. He bummed around Europe, where \n",
      "the massive, colorless buildings all seemed to crawl on top of him. He \n",
      "tried to work up the nerve for Asia or North Africa, but when the time \n",
      "came he got on a plane for Mexico City instead. And it was there, piss-\n",

      "There was a postage stamp photo of Thomas on the back cover. He \n",

      "There was a wistful quality when he talked about them that Eddie \n",

      "the Mexican rain forest, and Eddie saw he’d made it just in time. \n",
      "That had been three years ago. He hadn’t expected the Lacandones \n",
      "to make him a better guitarist. All he knew was acid and yoga and mac-\n",

      "In three years he’d lived a couple months with Nuk, one of Chan \n",
      "Ma’ax’s daughters, who’d gotten more and more distant every day; he’d \n",
      "had a week or so with an evangelista girl from the Christian side of the \n",

      "And beyond the sudden widening of the doctor’s eyes when she came, \n",
      "the quick “oh” of her indrawn breath, he’d had no effect on any of them.\n",
      "“Listen,” Eddie said to Chan Ma’ax in halting Mayan. “Some-\n",

      "supposed to be the last ones with a working knowledge of the Mayan \n",
      "calendar and ceremonies, could even, some said, talk to the gods. They \n",
      "knew where the sacred mushrooms were and how to use them.\n",
      "As soon as the word came out of his mouth Chan Zapata shut up, too \n",
      "embarrassed even to change the subject. After that Eddie had gone to \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax and then to the rest of the village, but even a mention of \n",
      "the Haawo’ turned him invisible on the spot.\n",
      "Finally young Ma’ax Garcia had taken him aside and said, “It’s bad \n",
      "luck to talk about...you know. The thing you were asking about. Okay? \n",
      "It’s bad luck even to say the name. I’ll probably get bit by a nauyaca for \n",

      "Eddie could take a hint, then as well as now.\n",
      "He stood up and said, “Okay, Max. I’m sorry. No estoy aqui por pendejo. \n",
      "I’ll shut up.”\n",

      "He walked out into the center of the clearing and let the stupefying \n",
      "July heat wash over him. He shut his eyes and concentrated on the pores \n",
      "of his skin and felt his sweat break all at once, on the backs of his knees \n",

      "34 lewis shiner\n",
      "To hell with it, he thought. Time to move on.\n",
      "Everything snapped into focus. He tasted the dust in the air, smelled \n",
      "the jungle broiling in the sunlight, heard the high pitched drone of \n",
      "the cicadas like dueling synthesizers and, over them, the faint voices of \n",
      "women on the far side of the clearing.\n",
      "Nepal, maybe. Why not? He thought about ragged, ice-covered \n",
      "mountains, impossibly green terraces set into the sides of valleys, white-\n",
      "washed monasteries growing out of cliffs. For a second he saw them \n",
      "superimposed on the drab browns and tans of the village.\n",
      "It would be complicated. He didn’t know the politics anymore, didn’t \n",
      "know if he could even get into Nepal. He would have to spend a while \n",
      "in the real world, long enough to get his bearings and put some money \n",
      "together.\n",
      "He went on to his hut feeling lightheaded, precarious. The hut \n",
      "was the same general shape as the godhouse, longer than it was wide, \n",
      "rounded on the ends and thatched with sweet palm leaves. Unlike the \n",
      "godhouse it had walls of a sort, vertical strips of yellow bamboo, braided \n",
      "with string and baling wire.\n",
      "He opened the door and a woman’s voice from inside said, “Tal in \n",
      "wilech.” I have come to see you.\n",
      "“Nuk?”\n",
      "“Yes,” she said, switching to Spanish. “I need to talk to you.”\n",
      "He made her out in the dimness. She was barrel chested and thick \n",
      "waisted, not even as tall as Eddie’s shoulders, but she was a beauty by \n",
      "local standards. His eyes found the red of the tattered plastic anthurium \n",
      "she always wore in her hair.\n",
      "Eddie shut the door and sat in the hammock. He smelled the dry, \n",
      "spicy odor of her skin and thought about the nights they’d spent to-\n",
      "gether. “¿Como no?” he said.\n",
      "“It’s about my father.”\n",
      "“I saw him a minute ago. He’s getting ready to drink balché.”\n",
      "“Yes,” she said. “They will drink balché and in the morning they will \n",
      "go on a pilgrimage to Na Chan.”\n",
      "“Pilgrimage,” Eddie said, stunned. Na Chan wasn’t just a ruin that his \n",
      "brother had tried to excavate. It was where Chan Ma’ax’s gods lived. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax would never talk about what went on there. It was hach \n",
      "winik stuff, for real people only.\n",
      "“He must not go. He’s old, almost eighty. The government has told \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 35\n",
      "him to stay away from there. If he goes I don’t think he’ll come back. \n",
      "You have to talk to him.”\n",
      "“I don’t know why you’re asking me,” Eddie said. He didn’t want it \n",
      "to sound bitter, but it came out that way just the same.\n",
      "“He trusts you. He thinks you are a good man. He listens to you.”\n",
      "“He’d listen better to Ma’ax Garcia.”\n",
      "“Ma’ax Garcia is too much a part of the old ways. He doesn’t care \n",
      "about the danger.”\n",
      "The old ways. Nuk was awed by cars and planes and portable stereos. \n",
      "She still talked about the tv she’d seen in San Cristóbal five years ago. \n",
      "That’s what I am to her, Eddie thought. Just one more new thing.\n",
      "“If he talks to me,” Eddie said. “I’ll do what I can. I’ll tell him I think \n",
      "it’s dangerous. Okay?”\n",
      "“Thank you, Eddie.” She leaned over him, kissed him quickly and ran \n",
      "out the door. Her lips were soft and he felt the kiss a long time after she \n",
      "was gone.\n",
      "He stood in front of his shaving mirror, hating the way he looked. \n",
      "It made him nervous, impatient. He got out his straight razor and cut his \n",
      "shoulder length hair to within an inch or so of his skull. He had to do \n",
      "the back by feel. When he was finished he washed himself with the last \n",
      "of his hard pink shaving soap and water from the clay jug in the corner.\n",
      "There was a bamboo shelf in one corner and he reached to the back \n",
      "of it and took down his shoulder bag. The zipper was stiff from disuse. \n",
      "He got out a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and put them on. The jeans were \n",
      "loose, but he punched a new hole in the belt.\n",
      "The longest journey begins with a single step, he thought. Already \n",
      "he felt different, cut off from the heartbeat of the village, his genitals \n",
      "armored in heavy denim.\n",
      "He rolled the mirror and razor up in the blue and orange strings of the \n",
      "hammock and put them in the bag. There wasn’t anything else to pack.\n",
      "He left the bag sitting in the dust of the floor and picked up his \n",
      "guitar. It was a gut string acoustic he’d bought for twenty dollars in the \n",
      "mercado in Mexico City. The action was brutal and the octaves were \n",
      "about a quarter tone off, but he’d been trying to wean himself from ma-\n",
      "terial objects and it had seemed like a good idea at the time. He carried \n",
      "it back outside and saw Chan Zapata headed for the godhouse.\n",
      "“Hey,” Eddie said. “Chan Zapata.”\n",
      "36 lewis shiner\n",
      "The kid turned around and smiled nervously at Eddie. He was one of \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax’s youngest sons, only in his twenties. Everybody seemed to \n",
      "assume he would take Chan Ma’ax’s place when the time came. He had \n",
      "a smooth face and penetrating eyes and he worked hard for Chan Ma’ax \n",
      "when he wasn’t on a binge in San Cristóbal. He made souvenir bows \n",
      "and arrows that he traded for aguardiente and whores, and every time he \n",
      "came home his wife had moved out. She would stay gone a week or so \n",
      "and then he’d convince her he’d never do it again. \n",
      "He would be going to Na Chan if anyone did.\n",
      "“How’s the balché?” Eddie asked him. \n",
      "“Good,” Chan Zapata said. “Heavy.” It was Chan Zapata’s job to carry \n",
      "the balché from the ceremonial canoe to the godhouse. He had to use a \n",
      "huge clay pot, the size of an old-fashioned kettle. \n",
      "“So,” Eddie said. “Tomorrow you go to Na Chan, no?” \n",
      "Eddie assumed Chan Zapata would ignore the question, the way his \n",
      "father ignored anything he didn’t want to hear. Instead he looked angry. \n",
      "“No,” Chan Zapata said. “Not me.” \n",
      "“Why not?” \n",
      "“You don’t know?” Chan Zapata said. “Truly?” \n",
      "“Truly,” Eddie said. “I don’t.” \n",
      "“Then it’s not for me to tell you.” Chan Zapata smiled again, sadly \n",
      "this time, and walked away. \n",
      "Everybody else was back from the milpa, the corn field on the \n",
      "far side of the lake. Maybe fifteen men sat or squatted in a loose hierar-\n",
      "chy on the floor of the godhouse. Eddie nodded to them and sat next \n",
      "to Ma’ax Garcia. Nobody said anything about his clothes. Ma’ax Garcia \n",
      "handed him a bowl of the deep brown balché and Eddie took it in both \n",
      "hands. It tasted a little like weak stout, a little like strong pulque. Eddie \n",
      "drank it off and Ma’ax Garcia passed it forward to be filled again. When \n",
      "the bowl came back Eddie set it at his feet and wrapped both hands \n",
      "around the neck of his guitar.\n",
      "Chan Zapata served the balché from a big clay pot at the front of the \n",
      "godhouse. He didn’t meet Edie’s eyes. The others sat in twos and threes, \n",
      "drinking, complaining about the Christian converts on the north end \n",
      "of the lake who’d sold off the mahogany and kept all the money for \n",
      "themselves. One old man asked Chan Zapata if he’d saved up enough \n",
      "“arrows” for a trip to San Cristóbal and everybody laughed.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 37\n",
      "If I painted myself purple, Eddie thought, would anybody say anything?\n",
      "Chan Zapata took the pot back out to the canoe to refill it. The full \n",
      "pot had to weigh close to a hundred pounds and he staggered back with \n",
      "his knees bent and his arms all the way around it. His face was agonized. \n",
      "If he dropped it the gods would never forgive him. Past the edge of the \n",
      "roof Eddie could see towering black clouds blowing in from the Gulf, \n",
      "erasing Chan Zapata’s shadow and turning the jungle behind him into a \n",
      "wall of foggy green.\n",
      "The rain started just as suddenly, falling in handfuls that cratered the \n",
      "dust outside and filled the air with the rusty smell of ozone. The sky \n",
      "cracked into a web of white lines and the thunder came after it fast and \n",
      "loud enough to make one of the old men jump.\n",
      "“It’s only lightning,” Chan Ma’ax said. His monkey face wrinkled \n",
      "with silent laughter. “Nuxi’ is afraid Cabracan is waking up.” The others \n",
      "laughed and Chan Ma’ax said to Eddie, “Cabracan is what they call in \n",
      "Spanish the temblor.”\n",
      "“Earthquake,” Eddie said in English. The old man’s smile terrified \n",
      "him. There had been earthquakes in California all week, in the Sierra \n",
      "Nevadas, like they’d been predicting for years. He’d heard it on the ra-\n",
      "dio yesterday, in between garbled reports that Carla had been killed and \n",
      "the last of her guerrillas wiped out.\n",
      "“Urt quack,” Chan Ma’ax said. “Urtquack.” He finished his balché and \n",
      "tucked his legs up under him. “You know the story of Hunahpu and \n",
      "Xbalanque and Cabracan?”\n",
      "“No,” Eddie said. The godhouse went quiet and Chan Ma’ax started \n",
      "to talk.\n",
      "“Heart of Heaven sends Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the twins, to \n",
      "kill Cabracan. Cabracan, you know, he has been saying, ‘I am greater \n",
      "than the sun. I shake the earth and sky and everyone bows down before \n",
      "me.’ Heart of Heaven, of course, he can’t just let this go.\n",
      "“Cabracan is walking across the land, shaking the mountains flat, and \n",
      "the work is making him hungry. He sees Hunahpu and Xbalanque and \n",
      "says, ‘Who are you?’\n",
      "“‘Nobody,’ says Hunahpu. ‘We are only hunters.’\n",
      "“‘What do you have to eat, then?’ says Cabracan.\n",
      "“Now Hunahpu and Xbalanque have the idea that they must bind \n",
      "Cabracan to the earth. They shoot quetzal birds from the branches with \n",
      "38 lewis shiner\n",
      "their blowguns and the giant thinks it is really wonderful because they \n",
      "only use air instead of darts. They cook the birds and they smear some \n",
      "of them with white lime from the lime pits and cook them until they \n",
      "are golden brown and dripping with juices.\n",
      "“The giant eats the birds that have the lime on them and then he \n",
      "starts walking toward the west again, smashing the mountains. But the \n",
      "lime is making him heavy and it is harder and harder for him to lift his \n",
      "arms or his feet.\n",
      "“He begins to stumble and fall. Soon he can’t get up again and he \n",
      "falls asleep under the mountains. Hunahpu and Xbalanque dance on \n",
      "the ground that covers him, but they are so noisy that they anger Heart \n",
      "of Heaven. Heart of Heaven wanted to see a good contest and is disap-\n",
      "pointed that the twins beat Cabracan by trickery.\n",
      "“So every year, while Cabracan sleeps, Heart of Heaven lets him get \n",
      "stronger. You can hear him sometimes turning in his sleep, making the \n",
      "mountains shake the way he used to. Making the urt quack.”\n",
      "Chan Ma’ax refilled his bowl, drank it all, smacked his lips. No one \n",
      "moved. They knew when there was more coming, like the audience at a \n",
      "symphony that knew when not to clap.\n",
      "Finally Chan Ma’ax said, “If you go east, toward the old cities of \n",
      "Chichén Itzá or Tulum you can see the land where Cabracan knocked \n",
      "the mountains down. Cabracan is very restless now and soon he will \n",
      "wake up and shake these mountains to pieces.”\n",
      "He looked at Eddie. “Wearing the clothes of a hach winik will not save \n",
      "you.” Eddie thought there was approval in the old man’s voice and it \n",
      "caught him off guard. “Hunahpu and Xbalanque will not save you. They \n",
      "are a part of the old ways. After Cabracan wakes up there will be only \n",
      "new ways.”\n",
      "The balché made another round. The old man had always told \n",
      "sports stories before, Hunahpu and Xbalanque playing fútbol with the \n",
      "king of the underworld. Nothing like this.\n",
      "And then Eddie remembered Thomas’s book. According to the \n",
      "Mayan calendar a five-thousand-year cycle was coming to an end. It \n",
      "was supposed to wind up with some kind of disaster that would wipe \n",
      "everything out. The book figured it to be earthquakes.\n",
      "Jesus Christ, Eddie thought. He’s talking about the end of the world.\n",
      "“Play something, Eddie,” Chan Ma’ax said.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 39\n",
      "“Yes, for God’s sake,” Nuxi’ said. “Something cheerful.”\n",
      "Eddie picked up the guitar. What they liked best were the rancheras, \n",
      "the traditional crap like “Cielito Lindo” that they could sing along with, \n",
      "but they liked old rock and roll too. He tried “Twist and Shout” and \n",
      "then “La Bamba” to the same chords, but the lyrics depressed him sav-\n",
      "agely. He stopped singing and just hammered the chords, hard enough \n",
      "to split his cuticles and to pull the strings out of tune.\n",
      "They had all been singing along, slapping their hands in the dust to \n",
      "keep time, but now they stopped and stared at him. The chords disin-\n",
      "tegrated into two- and three-string grips, and then out of it somehow \n",
      "came a melody line, taking Eddie by surprise.\n",
      "His fingers ground into the neck, slurring and smearing the notes, the \n",
      "cheap strings rasping skin from his fingertips, the music pouring out of \n",
      "him uncontrolled. He didn’t have any idea how long it went on. Finally \n",
      "his hands slowed on their own and the notes trailed off into silence.\n",
      "He got up. He was breathing hard, like he’d been running. He walked \n",
      "out into the rain and let the cool water run down his face.\n",
      "After a few seconds he felt the pressure of the balché in his bladder. He \n",
      "walked a little farther into the jungle and loosed a strong, clear stream \n",
      "into the undergrowth. He was already high, not fuzzily drunk but tight \n",
      "and focused as a laser. It took a long time to piss.\n",
      "When he turned back he saw Chan Ma’ax with the front of his \n",
      "robe tucked under his chin, using a neighboring bush. He took a \n",
      "breath and let it go. “Listen, Max,” he said. “It’s over. It’s time for me \n",
      "to move on.”\n",
      "“Okay,” Chan Ma’ax said, smiling.\n",
      "A vague guilt nagged at him, like he’d left the water running some-\n",
      "where. He wondered if he was being an idiot. Too late, he told himself. \n",
      "He took another step toward the godhouse.\n",
      "“Eddie,” the old man said. Eddie stopped. The old man looked over \n",
      "his shoulder and grinned like he was brain damaged. “I have a goodbye \n",
      "song to sing for you.” He straightened out his tunic and faced Eddie and \n",
      "started to sing. The words were meaningless warbling noises but they \n",
      "approximated the lyrics and melody to “Whatcha Gonna Do,” the only \n",
      "hit Eddie ever had, peaking just under the top 40 in 1974.\n",
      "Eddie’s teeth started to chatter. This isn’t happening, he thought.\n",
      "“I have that little radio, you know,” Chan Ma’ax said. “I listen to it \n",
      "all the time. I hear crazy things on there sometimes.” He waited a few \n",
      "40 lewis shiner\n",
      "seconds and then he said, “I don’t have answers, Eddie. All I have are the \n",
      "old ways, and the old ways are finished. You understand?”\n",
      "Eddie nodded. He didn’t seem to be able to talk.\n",
      "“We go on a pilgrimage to Na Chan tomorrow. The last time. To say \n",
      "goodbye. You understand?”\n",
      "Eddie nodded again.\n",
      "“You want to come?”\n",
      "Na Chan, Eddie thought. Na Chan and the mushrooms and gods that \n",

      "ning down his back, soaking his jeans. “Yes, I want to come.”\n",
      "“Groovy,” Chan Ma’ax said and walked away.\n",
      "And then, so gently that afterwards he couldn’t be sure it had really \n",
      "happened, he felt the ground tilt and settle under him, like a boat tak-\n",
      "ing a wave. Enough to turn fear to terror for a long second. To turn the \n",
      "solid earth to eggshells, to betray everything he’d ever taken for granted.\n",
      "He wanted to fall down and cling to the rain-soaked grass, but it \n",
      "wasn’t the kind of thing a hach winik would do. He stood and watched \n",
      "the rain drops cluster on a stalk of bamboo. The last time, he thought. To \n",
      "say goodbye.\n",
      "Each drop shone with a fierce and crystalline light. For the moment \n",
      "it was enough.\n",

      "he wouldn’t go into the studio for months yet, even though the record \n",
      "wouldn’t be finished for another year and a half. That much was okay \n",
      "because playing the guitar was what he did. He was worried about the \n",

      "But none of that was Ignacio’s fault. She was about to make the \n",
      "expected noises when she saw she’d lost his attention. He was staring \n",
      "down at a crippled old man, limping up the steps toward them. Lindsey \n",
      "looked away, embarrassed and a little annoyed at the same time. There \n",
      "were beggars everywhere in the city, even right downtown here, and \n",
      "they never gave up. They waited for you in the subway entrances, \n",
      "wrapped in shawls, with pathetic, fly-covered children. They chased \n",
      "you through the park with their shine kits, yelling insults about the \n",
      "condition of your shoes. \n",
      "This old man was almost completely devoid of color. He wore loose \n",
      "khaki pants, stained to the color of pavement, and a dark gray zipped \n",
      "jacket. His skin had the same asphalt color. She’d sent him away at least \n",
      "once every time she’d been in the park. She was raising her hand to \n",
      "wave him off again when Ignacio called him over. I really don’t need \n",
      "this, she thought. \n",
      "“¿Como va?” Ignacio asked him, and the two of them started talking \n",
      "in slurred Spanish. Lindsey couldn’t make out a single word. For the \n",
      "hundredth time she promised herself she would learn the language. She \n",
      "could start that afternoon. She even had a copy of Spanish Made Simple \n",
      "and a Spanish-English dictionary back in her room. They were the relic \n",
      "of a night-school course, from back when night school had seemed like \n",
      "a good idea. She hadn’t gotten past the third week. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 45\n",
      "The old man squatted on the step below hers, holding a cigar box in \n",
      "his lap. There were coins and a few dirty bills in the box, and carefully \n",
      "ordered rows of cellophane-wrapped gum, four pieces to the package. \n",
      "They were Chiclets, the little white candy-covered squares of gum that \n",
      "Lindsey hadn’t seen since she was a kid. Her mother used to give her \n",
      "Chiclets to keep her from getting carsick and they only seemed to make \n",
      "it worse. She didn’t know the stuff was still being made. The sight of it \n",
      "brought back memories of a stuffy back seat and Walt Disney’s Comics \n",
      "and Stories and the dry taste of vomit in the back of her throat. \n",
      "Ignacio gestured and pulled a money clip out of his front pants \n",
      "pocket. The old man gave him one of the packets and Ignacio dropped \n",
      "a 500-peso note in the old man’s box. It was worth a little less than a \n",
      "dollar now. Lindsey could remember trips into Tijuana only a few years \n",
      "ago when it had been worth forty. \n",
      "“Everybody has a story to tell,” Ignacio said. “Remember this. I was \n",
      "afraid of men like this, but then I learn. Everyone has a story, and if you \n",
      "ask, they tell it to you.” \n",
      "“So what did he tell you?” \n",
      "“He used to be a chiclero. You know what that is?”\n",
      "“It means he sells gum?” \n",
      "“It means he was a criminal. Not a bad man, only a little criminal. \n",
      "But they put him loose in the forest with a machete. If he comes back \n",
      "each month with the chicle, the juice from a kind of tree, they give him \n",
      "food and whiskey. Then they sell the chicle to the United States to make \n",
      "this things.” He held up the packet of gum. \n",
      "She risked another look at the old man. There was a long scar \n",
      "across the top of his nose that curved around under his eye and across \n",
      "to his ear. The wrists that came out of his jacket sleeves were thin as \n",
      "chicken drumsticks. \n",
      "“How horrible,” she said. \n",
      "“He says is not so bad. After thirty years you get a, cómo, a promoción.” \n",
      "He held up the wrapped gum again. \n",
      "“Promotion,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“Sí, promotion.” Ignacio and the old man were laughing now. The \n",
      "old man had two teeth, both uppers, one in front and one off to the \n",
      "side. His laughter was nearly soundless, though he opened his mouth \n",
      "wide for it. Lindsey felt like all of Mexico was laughing at her, laugh-\n",
      "ing because she was so ignorant and foreign and spoiled. She took her \n",
      "46 lewis shiner\n",
      "guidebook out of Ignacio’s hands and got up. Her cheeks felt sun-\n",
      "burned. She ran down the steps and into the crowd lined up for the bus \n",
      "on Avenida Juarez.\n",
      "The crowd slowed her to a walk and she looked down at her feet \n",
      "and pushed her way through. Someone grabbed her by the arm and she \n",
      "jerked it free. \n",
      "“Lindsey!” \n",
      "She turned back. It was Thomas. An old woman wrapped in lay-\n",
      "ers of black cotton had squeezed between them. Thomas looked hurt \n",
      "and confused, like she’d bitten him. A bus hissed to a stop at the curb \n",
      "and the old woman finally inched out of the way. Lindsey ran to \n",
      "him and put her arms around him. The bus gasped and rattled away. \n",
      "Thomas smelled clean and comfortable, like an old bed with fresh \n",
      "sheets on it. \n",
      "“Are you okay?” he said. \n",
      "“Yeah, I’m fine, it just...it’s been a weird morning. It’s like...” She \n",
      "stopped and listened, her head still against his blue oxford shirt. “There \n",
      "aren’t any birds. You always hear birds in the morning.” \n",
      "“Maybe the smog killed them all. Jesus, it’s bad here.” \n",
      "“I’m glad you came.” His hands were loose and awkward on her back. \n",
      "She didn’t want to let go of him. Finally she counted to three in her \n",
      "head and stepped away. \n",
      "“I got thrown out,” he said. “For a couple of weeks, anyway.” \n",
      "“Long enough. I don’t see how it could take more than a few days to \n",
      "fly up there and back.” \n",
      "“You never know.” \n",
      "“I’m really glad you’re here. Thank you, Thomas. I mean it.” \n",
      "“It’s okay. Can we get something to eat? I’ve been on buses and trains \n",
      "all morning.” \n",
      "“Sure,” she said. \n",
      "There was a thrashing sound in the dark green hedge that ran along \n",
      "the sidewalk. Something brushed against her leg. A few feet away some-\n",
      "body screamed. She started to look down, then looked at the screaming \n",
      "woman instead. It was a middle-aged woman in a blouse with a little \n",
      "bow at the throat. Her eyes seemed to be coming out of her head. \n",
      "Lindsey looked back at the sidewalk, turned, saw a gray rat the size \n",
      "of a shoe scuttling out into the street. “Oh my God,” she said, inhaling \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 47\n",
      "the words. Another rat lurched out from under a park bench, and then, \n",
      "twenty feet away, another. \n",
      "There were screams coming from everywhere now. Some kind of \n",
      "bizarre suicidal impulse was driving the rats into the street, dozens of \n",
      "them, thudding into the tires of the cars, scrabbling frantically at the \n",
      "pavement, going crazy from the howling of car horns and brakes. The \n",
      "stench of blood and burning rubber hung in the dead, humid air. Her \n",
      "stomach began to quiver. \n",
      "A shoulder slammed into the middle of her back and she huddled \n",
      "against Thomas again. People ran in circles, or ran back and forth along \n",
      "the edges of the street, all of them yelling or moaning or calling out to \n",
      "God. Some of them stood in one place and swung umbrellas like clubs. \n",
      "Men and women both had climbed up on the park benches and had \n",
      "their arms around each other. \n",
      "“Are they gone?” she whispered. \n",
      "“Mostly,” Thomas said. Lindsey looked up again and saw two more \n",
      "rats circling the Juarez monument, flashing between legs, their eyes wide \n",
      "and black with terror. \n",
      "“Where did they come from?” \n",
      "“They live in the park. They’re everywhere, you just never saw them \n",
      "before. Come on, let’s get out of here.” Thomas was looking a little \n",
      "queasy himself. He grabbed her hand and pulled at her. She shut her \n",
      "eyes and breathed through her mouth but her stomach wouldn’t settle. \n",
      "She felt dizzy, seasick. Maybe it was the pastries, she thought. The air \n",
      "was thick, motionless, unbreathable. \n",
      "There was a noise like a jet overhead, or like air being let out of a \n",
      "tire. The sidewalk turned to jelly. Thomas was jerked away from her and \n",
      "there was no place to stand. She couldn’t figure out what was going on. \n",
      "Thunder rumbled in the distance. She looked up at the clear morn-\n",
      "ing sky in confusion. Then she started shaking and it was a couple of \n",
      "seconds before she realized the ground was shaking her, like hands had \n",
      "grabbed her by the shoulders and were jerking her back and forth. She \n",
      "staggered half a step toward the street and then lurched backward, her \n",
      "arms flailing. Overhead the power lines cracked like whips and broke \n",
      "loose from their poles, spitting sparks and snaking through the air. \n",
      "Finally she understood and she said the word out loud: “Earthquake.”\n",
      "Cars were thrown sideways into each other as the street humped up \n",
      "like a shaken rug. Lindsey’s teeth banged against each other. The noise \n",
      "48 lewis shiner\n",
      "was unbelievable: the hissing, the rumbling, cars crashing, bricks and \n",
      "tiles smashing into the sidewalks. She dropped to her knees, then all \n",
      "fours, saw that she’d been turned completely around, back toward the \n",
      "Juarez monument. \n",
      "And then the columns started to move. \n",
      "They flexed and wobbled like they were pieces of string somebody \n",
      "was shaking instead of 20-foot columns of solid marble. She blinked and \n",
      "stared as waves rolled through the plaza, lifting marble blocks five feet \n",
      "into the air, crashing like heavy surf against the shore of the monument. \n",
      "Less than ten feet away a tree split with a crack that hurt her ears and \n",
      "tilted slowly across the sidewalk, groaning as if in pain. She could hear \n",
      "Thomas shouting her name but she couldn’t see him. Already the quake \n",
      "had seemed to last an hour, two hours, all her life. \n",
      "The worst of the noise eased off and she thought she heard gunfire, \n",
      "and tiny bells ringing after each shot. She glanced up long enough to \n",
      "see windows exploding out of the hotel across the street, glittering and \n",
      "weightless as soap bubbles, floating toward her. She ducked as the glass \n",
      "hit the curb with a faint tinkling noise, felt splinters prick her left arm \n",
      "and the side of her neck. \n",
      "If it would stop, she thought. If it would only stop. \n",
      "The Hotel Alameda, just down from the Del Prado, came apart with \n",
      "a noise like shuffling cards, amplified a thousand times. The collapse sent \n",
      "its own shock waves through the park and for a second the two forces \n",
      "fought each other like angry gods. Lindsey knew then that it was the \n",
      "end of the world, that it would go on this way forever, and the tears ran \n",
      "down her face and spattered the dust and broken glass on the sidewalk. \n",
      "It ended with a single long, convulsive shudder. In the silence that \n",
      "came after, Lindsey heard a stuck car horn somewhere in the distance, \n",
      "voices crying softly, a whisper of wind in the bushes. Then there were \n",
      "sirens everywhere. \n",
      "She turned her head. Thomas was sitting up on his heels a few feet \n",
      "away. He wiped his glasses with a corner of his shirt and put them back \n",
      "on. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong with him beyond a few \n",
      "scrapes and cuts. She tried standing up and Thomas got up to try to \n",
      "steady her. \n",
      "The ground felt wrong. It wasn’t moving anymore but it didn’t seem \n",
      "exactly solid, either. It was only her willpower that was keeping it \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 49\n",
      "together. If she ever relaxed, she thought, it would start again. It was a \n",
      "terrible responsibility. She didn’t know how she would ever be able to \n",
      "get any sleep. \n",
      "“You okay?” Thomas asked.\n",
      "“Uh huh. You?” \n",
      "He nodded. She moved her head so she could see the Alameda Hotel. \n",
      "The front wall was gone. The floors had all settled on top of each other, \n",
      "leaving a sandwich of mattresses, flowered dresses, and red plastic waste-\n",
      "baskets between the slices of concrete. Twisted rods of rebar stuck out ev-\n",
      "erywhere. People were climbing the mound of rubble, throwing chunks \n",
      "of debris to one side, digging into the ruins with their bare hands. \n",
      "“We can’t stay here,” Thomas said. “We’ll only be in the way.” \n",
      "“Shouldn’t we...I mean, aren’t there, like aftershocks or something?” \n",
      "“I don’t know,” Thomas said. “I know I could use a drink.” \n",
      "“I’ve got a bottle in my room.” She glanced back at the hotel. “But I \n",
      "don’t know if I want to go inside anywhere. Like ever again.” \n",
      "“It’s all right,” Thomas said. “It’s over.” \n",
      "The first aftershock came then, mocking him. Lindsey felt like she \n",
      "was trying to walk across a trampoline. It was so slow and gentle com-\n",
      "pared to the quake itself that she wanted to laugh hysterically and never \n",
      "ever stop. \n",
      "Thomas put his arm around her waist and pulled her close and they \n",
      "leaned into each other as they walked, like teenagers. Lindsey had always \n",
      "heard that coming close to death was a major turn-on. It was true; she \n",
      "could feel it happening. There was a hollow kind of ache between her \n",
      "legs and she could feel her nipples pushing out against her bra. \n",
      "Everything around her lost its focus. They crossed Avenida Juarez, \n",
      "chunks of broken safety glass sliding under her feet like marbles. She \n",
      "looked up and saw that the clock on the Latin American Tower was still \n",
      "running. It was only eleven in the morning. People sat on the sidewalk \n",
      "weeping. The air smelled of concrete dust. Bright spots of color kept \n",

      "neath, so it had settled a bit in the middle. But it was tile just the same. \n",
      "Carmichael sat on a metal folding chair. Once it had been the same \n",
      "color as the house, but most of the paint had flaked off. He was watch-\n",

      "It was Wednesday morning. Ten minutes ago, when he first got here, \n",
      "the bedroom door was open and he walked right in. He stopped when \n",
      "he saw Carla. She was sprawled across a hammock on her stomach, bit-\n",
      "ing down on a wad of saliva-soaked denim. The room smelled like raw \n",
      "hamburger. A woman in loose white pants and a white T-shirt stood \n",
      "over her. She was digging in the back of Carla’s thigh with hands that \n",
      "looked like they were smeared with melted chocolate. \n",
      "They had both stared at him and he’d quietly backed out of the room \n",
      "and shut the door. There was nobody else in the house. Faustino and \n",
      "the others were out trying to scare up food and money. The people \n",
      "who owned the place, whoever they were, had apparently decided to \n",
      "stay with relatives. Carmichael knew the feeling. He saw it in the faces \n",
      "of the people the rebels had put him with. That look of dread and guilt \n",
      "and impatience, the look of somebody that had been swindled and then \n",
      "found out they could go to jail for it. \n",
      "The bedroom door finally opened. The doctor stood drying her \n",
      "hands on a stolen hotel towel. “You can come in now,” she said. She had \n",
      "the vestiges of some kind of British accent. \n",
      "“Thanks,” Carmichael said. \n",
      "54 lewis shiner\n",
      "Carla nodded to him as he came in. She sat high in the hammock, \n",
      "fresh bandages on her shoulder and foot. Carmichael couldn’t see the \n",
      "bandages on her leg because of her jeans. She looked a bit stunned, but \n",
      "that was better than she’d looked ten minutes ago. \n",
      "The doctor had a deep tan and blonde hair that curved below her \n",
      "ears. The hair put parentheses around her pale eyes and jutting nose. Her \n",
      "oversized T-shirt, barely dented by her small, pointed breasts, was now \n",
      "lightly dotted with drying blood. \n",
      "It had been weeks since Carmichael had seen a woman from his own \n",
      "culture, which was to say, tall and blonde and English-speaking, not \n",
      "bound up in brassieres and long skirts and centuries of Catholicism. \n",
      "Despite the bloodstains he expected her to smell of perfume; in fact she \n",
      "didn’t smell of anything at all. \n",
      "“I’ve heard of you,” Carmichael said to her in English. “You’re the \n",
      "one that comes through Nahá every few months, takes care of the \n",
      " Lacandones. They all talked about you.” \n",
      "“Yes, that’s me. I just came from there, in fact.” \n",
      "“I was there about three weeks ago.” He tried to make eye contact \n",
      "with her but she was looking at her instruments, washing them in \n",
      "orange-stained water, and laying them out on a stack of the hotel hand \n",
      "towels. “I did a story on Chan Ma’ax.” \n",
      "“Mmmm,” she said. \n",
      "“One of the compas comes from Nahá,” Carla said in Spanish. \n",
      "Carmichael didn’t know she’d been paying attention, let alone that her \n",
      "English was good enough to keep up. “He talks all the time about this \n",
      "old brujo, this Chan Ma’ax. Is he still alive?” \n",
      "“As far as I know,” the doctor said, switching now to Spanish too. \n",
      "“I’m here two days early because Chan Ma’ax and half his village are \n",
      "off on a pilgrimage. Nahá is practically deserted.” \n",
      "“Where did they go?” Carmichael asked. “Na Chan?” \n",
      "The doctor nodded. She put the towels and the instruments into an \n",
      "expensive-looking leather and canvas backpack. \n",
      "“Na Chan,” Carla said. \n",
      "“It’s a beautiful place,” the doctor said. “I’ve been through there two \n",
      "or three times. The Americans got the place mostly dug up and then \n",
      "went off and left it again. It looks like the Mayans just left or something. \n",
      "Very eerie, sort of decayed-looking.” She buckled the pack and hefted it. \n",
      "“Well. I have to go. The arm and the thigh are not so bad, I think. The \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 55\n",
      "foot is serious. If you don’t take care of it, it may have to come off. It \n",
      "may have to come off anyway.” \n",
      "“Thank you for what you’ve done,” Carla said. “The revolution could \n",
      "use your skills.” \n",
      "“Your revolution is already giving me more patients than I can \n",
      "deal with.” \n",
      "“You don’t approve,” Carla said. \n",
      "“I don’t take sides. Yours or the government’s.” She got into the \n",
      "pack and adjusted the padding on the straps. “But I should warn you. \n",
      "There’s a big convoy of American soldiers outside town. They’re com-\n",

      "“Northamericans?” Carla asked. “¿Yanquis?” The way she came down \n",
      "on the “y” it sounded like “junkies.” \n",
      "“Yes,” the doctor said. \n",
      "“You’re sure?” Carmichael said. \n",
      "“Why should you expect to know about it?” Carla asked. “Your gov-\n",
      "ernment doesn’t tell you these things.” \n",
      "“But where did they come from?” Carmichael had lapsed into English. \n",
      "“The sky, I should think,” the doctor said. “Like great white gods. \n",
      "Descending from heaven on the wings of an airlift. Now if you’ll excuse \n",
      "me I really must be going.” \n",
      "“Wait,” Carmichael said. “Ever since I’ve been down here everybody’s \n",
      "sort of taken for granted that there were US troops here. But nobody \n",
      "had actually seen them with their own eyes.” \n",
      "The doctor was smiling to herself. “I expect you’ll have that privilege \n",
      "before much longer.” \n",
      "He didn’t want her to leave. “I don’t even know your name,” he said. \n",
      "“You won’t be needing it,” she said, and shut the door behind her.\n",
      "Carla sat up in the hammock. There was a pile of old woman’s \n",

      "“I thought you would be gone by now,” she said to Carmichael. \n",
      "“What happened to your story?” \n",
      "“I have a little portable computer in my pack. I wrote the story on \n",
      "the computer, and then sent it over the phone.” \n",
      "“Fantastic,” Carla said. “But aren’t you afraid to stay here?” \n",
      "“You have a meeting with Raul Venceremos. I want to see it. If I \n",
      "56 lewis shiner\n",
      "could just get some pictures, the two of you together, that would do it. I \n",

      "“You can trust me. You know you can. Faustino trusts me.” In fact \n",
      "Faustino had sent a correo to tell him where Carla was. “Don’t tell me \n",
      "Venceremos isn’t looking for publicity.” \n",
      "“All right, all right.” Even sitting up seemed to exhaust her. “You can \n",
      "come. But if Venceremos says no, you have to go away. You promise?” \n",
      "“Sure, okay, I promise.” \n",
      "“Good. Now get out of here and let me get dressed.” \n",
      "She wouldn’t let Carmichael walk with her. She told him she \n",
      "looked suspicious enough hobbling around on the crutch Faustino had \n",
      "made her. It was a forked branch, and the crosspiece was tied on with \n",
      "twine. Folded newspaper was scotch-taped into the fork for padding. \n",
      "Carmichael gave her a two-minute head start and then went after her. \n",
      "The streets were empty except for little clouds of dust that flared up \n",
      "in front of the wind. This was the upper-class part of town, separated \n",
      "from the jungle by a few acres of cornfields. It was high enough on the \n",
      "hillside that Carmichael could look down on the village church and the \n",
      "zócalo in front of it, half a mile away. As he moved downhill the blues \n",
      "and pinks and yellows of the houses gave way to whitewash and plain \n",
      "adobe or cinderblock. \n",
      "The doors and windows were shut. Word had obviously gotten out \n",
      "that the US soldiers were coming. There was a bonfire burning two \n",
      "streets away, and another at the foot of the hill. The air was full of sour \n",
      "smoke. The Sandinistas had used bonfires to lure people to their rallies. \n",
      "Now they were a symbol of revolution all across Latin America. \n",
      "Carmichael turned a corner and saw Carla a block and a half ahead \n",
      "of him, limping painfully. Her disguise was good. In the shawls and the \n",
      "rosary, the black dress padded out with dirty clothes, the red and green \n",
      "mesh plastic shopping bag, she was perfect. She was virtually invisible. \n",
      "She stopped in a doorway and talked to someone for a few seconds, \n",
      "then went inside. Carmichael counted to a hundred and walked up to \n",
      "the house. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 57\n",
      "There were two kids in jeans and T-shirts on the doorstep. They had \n",
      "bandanas on, ready to pull up over their faces Sandanista-style. The older \n",
      "one was maybe 15. In the shadow of the doorway Carmichael could \n",
      "see a .22 single-shot rifle. The younger boy had a Saturday night special \n",
      "tucked into his pants. \n",
      "“¿Qué queres, gabacho?” the older one asked. \n",
      "“I’m invited,” Carmichael said. \n",
      "“Invited to what?” \n",
      "“The meeting. Carla and Venceremos.” \n",
      "“You got the password?” the younger one said. \n",
      "“¡Cállate, pendejo!” said the older one, slapping him hard on top of the \n",
      "head. “There isn’t no fucking password.” \n",
      "“Quit hitting me!” The younger one’s eyes were red and his voice had \n",
      "turned shrill. \n",
      "“Shit, you’re such a baby.”\n",
      "Suddenly the younger one was standing up and his hand was on the \n",
      "cheap revolver. “I’m not a fucking baby.” \n",
      "Carmichael took a step back. \n",
      "“Okay, okay,” the older one said. “You’re not a baby. You’re a fuck-\n",
      "ing pendejo, but you’re not a baby. Now sit down and watch this asshole \n",
      "while I go ask.” He looked at Carmichael. “What’s your name?” \n",
      "“Carmichael. John Carmichael.” \n",
      "“Okay. You stay here while I go in. Or Rafael, he’ll shoot your ass.”\n",
      "“That’s right,” the young one said. \n",
      "The older one went inside with the rifle. “How old are you?” \n",
      "Carmichael asked. \n",
      "“None of your fucking business,” Rafael said. \n",
      "Carmichael raised his hands. “Yeah, okay,” he said. “Relax.” He \n",
      "stood in the heat and silence for a minute or so. Off in the distance \n",
      "he thought he heard the low hum of machinery. The US convoy, \n",
      "Carmichael thought. \n",
      "Then the older kid was back, motioning him in with his rifle barrel. \n",
      "“Raul Venceremos,” the man said. He got up and shook \n",
      "Carmichael’s hand. A few seconds before, Carmichael had taken him for \n",
      "a posturing clown. Now the smile and the body language were saying \n",
      "that Carmichael had no choice but to take him seriously. \n",
      "Venceremos wore neatly pressed green fatigues. He was short and \n",
      "58 lewis shiner\n",
      "heavy-set, with a thick mustache. He wore a black beret at an angle and \n",
      "had a single gold stud in his right ear. His handshake left cheap cologne \n",
      "on Carmichael’s fingers. \n",
      "Across the table from him, Carla had pulled her shawls down around \n",
      "her shoulders. The shopping bag was on the floor next to her, in easy \n",
      "reach. Carmichael knew there was a .45 automatic buried in the rags \n",
      "inside it. \n",
      "Two young soldiers with M16s leaned against the wall behind \n",
      "Venceremos, acting like they weren’t paying attention. Otherwise \n",
      "the house was empty. The young soldiers had clean fatigues, like \n",
      "Venceremos. Carla was staring hard at their boots. They were black, \n",
      "high-top combat boots that laced all the way up, probably Vietnam war \n",
      "surplus. Informant’s boots, the compas called them, because none of the \n",
      "real guerrillas could afford them. \n",
      "“Did you want pictures?” Venceremos asked. \n",
      "“Sure,” Carmichael said. “Can I get you two together?” \n",
      "“Not dressed like this,” Carla said. “I look like an idiot.” She waited \n",
      "for Carmichael to let her off the hook, but he didn’t say anything. He \n",
      "really wanted the pictures. Finally she unbuttoned the top of the heavy \n",

      "Everything seemed to be coming loose. \n",
      "Time to get the hell out of Dodge, Carmichael thought. Cobble \n",
      "something together on the computer, get the pictures developed \n",
      "before the film got accidentally X-rayed, and catch the next anything \n",
      "back to LA. It wasn’t going to be the story he wanted. It was going to \n",

      "horns came off the top corners and there was a laughing mouth under \n",

      "The men in the jeep didn’t make him feel any better. The sunlight \n",
      "was bright and the bar was dark and he could watch them without be-\n",

      "T-shirts, baseball caps, long hair, and cutoff and tie-dyed variations of fa-\n",

      "The jeep lurched forward again and the rest of the convoy rattled \n",

      "you think I want to hear? \n",

      "yet, or somebody would have come after him. Now all he had to do \n",
      "was get away. \n",
      "It was about five steps to the corner. After that they wouldn’t be able \n",
      "to see him. What are you worried about? he asked himself. They’re your \n",
      "fellow Americans. Ha ha ha. \n",
      "All he could think about were the guns. It wasn’t going to get easier. \n",
      "He opened the door and stepped out in the street. He didn’t want to \n",
      "turn his back to the jeeps in the square, but he did it anyway. \n",
      "He couldn’t remember how to walk normally. It was like sometimes \n",
      "when he was trying to get to sleep and he forgot how to swallow. Once \n",
      "he started thinking about it, it wasn’t automatic anymore and it got very \n",
      "awkward and his mouth filled up with spit. Walking now felt like there \n",
      "were strings going from his hands to the ends of his hiking boots, like \n",

      "a shooting gallery. \n",
      "The corner was a lifetime away, and then suddenly, finally, he was \n",
      "around it. \n",
      "He broke into a shuffling run. The streets all looked the same. Their \n",
      "names, set in tiles on the corners of the buildings, changed every few \n",
      "blocks. But he oriented himself by the bonfires and worked out where \n",
      "he had to go. \n",

      "about it. \n",
      "He slowed to a walk and started across. He couldn’t hear the roaring \n",

      "superstitiously afraid that they would be able to feel him watching. If \n",

      "out the front of his shirt. \n",
      "Somebody shouted. He heard an engine kick over. I’m dead, he \n",

      "saw there was nowhere to go. \n",
      "He ran to a door in the middle of the block and pounded on it. \n",
      "“Help me!” he shouted in Spanish. “For God’s sake! Let me in!” He \n",
      "tried the flimsy latch on the door and it opened. \n",

      "over where the screen should have been. He shut the gate behind him \n",
      "but didn’t see any way to bolt it. “Hello?” he said. He could hear jeeps \n",
      "in the street outside. \n",
      "He tried the door. It let into a kitchen, with a family sitting around \n",
      "a scarred wooden table. The mother was a short, thick campesina, the \n",
      "father not much taller, with a mustache and oiled hair. Four kids from \n",

      "with women’s dresses. The man pulled down an old green army blanket \n",
      "and then laced his hands together to make a step for Carmichael’s foot. \n",
      "It was the posture of the conquered, and it made Carmichael feel \n",

      "his expression. Carmichael put his hands on the shelves and let the man \n",
      "boost him up. \n",
      "His shoulders hit the walls and ceiling, and it took three tries to get \n",
      "his legs to bend far enough to squeeze them through the doorway. He \n",
      "clutched the camera, afraid it would fall and smash on the floor. He \n",
      "couldn’t seem to get his breath and sweat crawled out of his pores. The \n",
      "boards creaked and bent under him and he struggled to get his weight \n",
      "as close to the ends of the shelf as possible. \n",
      "Somebody was pounding at the door of the house. Carmichael heard \n",
      "shouting in Northamerican accents. The man threw the blanket back \n",
      "over him and shut the closet. Carmichael fought with the blanket until \n",
      "he could see stripes of light leaking between the boards of the door. \n",
      "The blanket was frayed and moth eaten and had a sweet, musky \n",
      "odor that nearly gagged him. It felt like sandpaper on his bare legs. His \n",
      "clothes were soaked in sweat and he thought he was going to black out. \n",
      "He forced himself to suck in huge lungfuls of air. \n",
      "He could hear plates and knives in the dining room, badly accented \n",
      "Spanish and the husband answering. What if he set me up? Carmichael \n",
      "thought. What if he chickens out? Or if he’s a lousy actor? What, for \n",
      "God’s sake, if they start lining up his kids and shooting them until he \n",
      "tells where I am? Would our guys do that? \n",
      "His left leg started to go numb. The muscles in his right leg were hard \n",
      "as steel cables. Claustrophobia. He’d never had it before. He needed to \n",
      "be able to kick his legs and stretch his shoulders and he would be all \n",
      "right. Knowing he couldn’t, feeling the pressure of the gritty mud walls \n",
      "around him, gave him fierce muscle spasms. \n",
      "He turned enough that blood could get to his left leg, then braced \n",
      "against the walls and pushed. Pushed and relaxed. It was starting to help \n",
      "when he heard something outside the closet. \n",
      "He could see somebody moving in the bedroom, making shadows \n",
      "through the cracks in the door. He heard the mattress come off the \n",
      "flimsy metal springs and hit the floor. “Closet,” a voice said in English. \n",
      "The door opened. Carmichael saw a white kid with a mohawk, not a \n",
      "punk mohawk but a wide strip of short-cut hair down the center of his \n",
      "head. He wore fatigue pants and a Def Leppard T-shirt. The black man \n",
      "behind him was bare-chested, with camo pants and a rolled bandana \n",
      "68 lewis shiner\n",
      "around his forehead. They both had bullpups, plastic infantry rifles that \n",
      "looked like toys, the trigger guards and handle too far forward and the \n",
      "magazine coming out of the buttstock. \n",
      "The white kid poked his gun around in the clothes. “Ain’t shit in \n",
      "here,” he said. “Bunch a fuckin’ dresses.” \n",
      "“Let’s move,” the black man said. \n",
      "They left the closet door open and the mattress on the floor. Slowly \n",
      "Carmichael let the air out of his lungs. He heard them crashing through \n",
      "the rest of the house and then everything went quiet. \n",
      "He waited another half hour before he finally staggered back onto \n",
      "the street, drenched in sour sweat, muscles cramped and aching, heart-\n",
      "sick and afraid.\n",
      "A correo came for him that night in the safehouse. It was a ten-\n",
      "year-old girl he’d never seen before. She took him to the edge of the \n",
      "jungle where Carla and Faustino were sitting a few yards off the trail, \n",
      "waiting for him. \n",
      "“The soldiers didn’t find you,” Carmichael said, sitting down next \n",
      "to them. He could barely hear his own whisper over the grinding of \n",
      "the insects. \n",
      "“No,” Carla said. “But we can’t stay any longer.” \n",
      "“Where can you go?” \n",
      "“Back in the mountains. To Na Chan, I think.” \n",
      "“Is this...because of that vision you had? That Kukulcán business?” \n",
      "“No,” Carla said. “It’s just good sense. The ruins give us plenty of \n",
      "cover. The government wouldn’t think to look for us there. If they did, \n",
      "they wouldn’t attack for fear of hurting the temples.” \n",
      "Faustino watched her while she talked and then looked at Carmichael. \n",
      "“It’s because of the goddamned vision,” he said. \n",
      "“You think I’m crazy,” Carla said. \n",
      "“Yes.” \n",
      "“Are we going to have a mutiny? A coup?” \n",
      "“Not yet,” Faustino said. “You’re still too weak. It would be no contest.” \n",
      "“A joke,” Carla said. “My God, he made a joke. Don’t forget to tell \n",
      "this in your story. The night Faustino made a joke.” \n",
      "They all stood up. “I had to hide from the soldiers,” Carmichael \n",
      "said. “My own people, my own countrymen. I had to hide in this little \n",
      "closet. I was lying there, thinking, this is crazy, you can talk to them, \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 69\n",
      "explain everything. But I couldn’t. If I’d had a gun I think I would have \n",
      "killed them, I was so afraid.” \n",
      "“Where do you go now?” Carla asked. \n",
      "“I’m going to find out about this Colonel Marsalis, find out what \n",
      "these soldiers are doing here. That’s where the story is now.” \n",
      "“Good luck,” Carla said. \n",
      "“You too,” Carmichael told her. He couldn’t help thinking, as he \n",
      "watched her limp off down the trail, that she was going to need it more \n",
      "than he would. \n",
      "The next morning Carmichael woke up to the sound of starters \n",
      "cranking. It was dawn. He borrowed a pair of ragged pants and a beat-\n",
      "up straw cowboy hat from a pile of clothes in the corner. Standing in \n",
      "the open doorway he could see the soldiers all the way down at the end \n",
      "of the street, driving uphill toward him. \n",
      "And then, without any kind of signal, things began to fly out of the \n",
      "doors and windows that faced the street. Bottles, cans, broken furniture, \n",
      "sacks of garbage, old tires. Nothing hit the jeeps, or even came close. It \n",
      "just piled up in the road in front of them. \n",
      "Carmichael stepped back into the shadows. The lead jeep crawled by, \n",
      "the driver hunched over the wheel, swerving around the worst of the \n",
      "glass and nails and piles of trash. The men in the back of the jeep were \n",
      "standing up, facing the houses with rifles up and ready. But they didn’t \n",
      "have anything to shoot at. \n",
      "Carmichael remembered the way they’d come into town, racing their \n",
      "engines and laughing and shouting. They weren’t shouting now. The \n",
      "thought made him feel tight and congested, like he had a chest cold. \n",
      "“Adiós, motherfuckers,” he whispered, and then he started laughing. \n",
      "It was a long time before he could stop. By then the sun was up and \n",
      "the jeeps were gone and the streets were full of broken glass.\n",

      "E\n",
      "ddie’s sense of time got turned around in the moonlight. He \n",
      "was in a hammock off to himself, about fifty feet from the Temple \n",
      "of the Inscriptions. A stucco serpent god stared down at him from one \n",
      "corner of the pyramid. The moonlight made it look like it had been \n",
      "carved that afternoon. The pits and scars faded away, the low, flat fore-\n",
      "head tilted toward him, the cheeks bulged into spheres, and the fangs \n",
      "arched in a hideous smile. \n",
      "The god was young again and the city was his. \n",
      "As an exercise, Eddie made himself work out the date. Wednesday, July \n",
      "16, 1986. The numbers didn’t mean anything to him. \n",
      "He’d expected to find the lost city of Na Chan buried under jungle \n",
      "and tons of earth. Instead the half-dozen temples Thomas had restored \n",
      "were still pretty clear. He could see their shapes, even in the daytime \n",
      "when his imagination was at low ebb. The clearings had filled in with \n",
      "skinny fruit trees and low palm thickets, but the sense of the place, of its \n",
      "geography, was still there. \n",
      "So were its ghosts. Eddie heard them in the, long, narrow rooms on \n",
      "top of the pyramids. He thought about the power that a physical place \n",
      "could have, to be able to warp time. He’d felt it from the start, from the \n",
      "first time he saw the serpent god. \n",
      "It had taken them three days to walk from Nahá. At least a dozen \n",
      "times during the first day Eddie was sure they were going to have to \n",
      "leave him behind. He was out of shape, hung over from the balché, and \n",
      "he still didn’t know why Chan Ma’ax had decided to let him come. He \n",
      "was wearing socks and tennis shoes, but the socks were worn through at \n",
      "the heel and just behind the big toe. \n",
      "When the afternoon rain hit, they just kept walking. Eddie couldn’t \n",
      "believe it. The rain came down so hard it bent his head and shoulders \n",
      "over, so hard that he could barely see Ma’ax Garcia right in front of him. \n",
      "There were 12 Lacandones, making 13 of them altogether. Thirteen \n",
      "men on July 13. Eddie didn’t much like the omens. Half the men in the \n",
      "71\n",
      "72 lewis shiner\n",
      "village had come; Chan Zapata was one of the ones that hadn’t. When \n",
      "Eddie asked Chan Ma’ax for a reason, all he got was the silent routine. \n",
      "Eddie’s breath steamed out in the rain. Everything had gone gray. The \n",
      "dirt of the logging road turned instantly to fine-grained mud that clung \n",
      "like cement. He heard a kissing noise behind him, the Mexican equiva-\n",
      "lent of a whistle or a “hey, you.” He looked back. Nuxi’ was waving at \n",
      "him to get out of the road. The others had already climbed down out of \n",
      "the way. \n",
      "There was a logging truck coming at them, just headlights and a black \n",
      "shape in the rain. Eddie stepped down and watched the long empty bed \n",
      "of the truck rattle past. We could all ride there, he thought. We’re using \n",
      "their road. What’s the difference if we sell out just a little more? \n",
      "It was like Chan Ma’ax heard what he was thinking. They suddenly \n",
      "turned off onto a trail that was so narrow Eddie could hardly be sure \n",
      "it was there. They were completely under the trees now. The rain hit \n",
      "them in trickles and sprays, making clicking noises as it worked down \n",
      "through the network of leaves. The tops of the trees were forty or fifty \n",
      "feet above them and there was plenty of room between the trunks for \n",
      "them to walk. \n",
      "Eventually the rain stopped and the sun came out. The light seemed \n",
      "to thicken the air, like flour stirred into a sauce. It was hard to breathe. \n",
      "Eddie’s wet socks ground into the blisters on his feet and he had stitches \n",
      "in both sides. \n",
      "They walked until all the light was gone and then built a fire. One of \n",
      "the men had killed a peccary while Eddie wasn’t paying attention. The \n",
      "roasting meat smelled wonderful but Eddie had been a vegetarian so \n",
      "long he knew he couldn’t digest it. \n",
      "He woke up shivering at dawn, his clothes and hammock and mos-\n",
      "quito net soaked completely through with dew. Within fifteen minutes \n",
      "they were moving again. \n",
      "By the third day, Eddie was strong enough to notice more of what \n",
      "was going on around him. Nuxi’ explained to him how the jungle had \n",
      "changed in the last fifty years. Most of the big animals were gone. The \n",
      "migrant Tzeltal Indians had moved deeper into the jungle, cutting and \n",
      "burning vast acres of trees for their milpas and leaving only grasslands \n",
      "behind. Now there were logging roads everywhere and the smell of die-\n",
      "sel never quite went away. \n",
      "On the afternoon of the third day Eddie saw his first limestone block, \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 73\n",
      "just off the trail, etched in green moss and covered with decaying leaves. \n",
      "Nuxi’ stopped next to him. Eddie said, “It’s from—” He didn’t know \n",
      "the word in Mayan. “—un templo. Yes?” \n",
      "Nuxi’ nodded. “It gets better,” he said. “You don’t have to stop here.” \n",
      "The Lacandones all seemed excited. They were talking to each other for \n",
      "the first time, moving faster down the trail. \n",
      "They walked downhill, deeper into a valley. The single stones became \n",
      "mounds of rock, the exposed surfaces got more ornate. Through veils of \n",
      "branches Eddie could see a stucco hand or a carved helmet, like scat-\n",
      "tered pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. \n",
      "The path bent around a hill of broken stone and the valley opened \n",
      "out in front of him. \n",
      "He recognized the landmarks from his brother’s book. Straight ahead \n",
      "were the long, low ruins of the Palace. It could have been a collapsed \n",
      "twentieth-century courthouse, except for the mansard-style corbelled \n",
      "roofs and the four-story observatory that came out of the middle like a \n",
      "bell tower. To Eddie’s right was the Temple of the Inscriptions, a stepped \n",
      "pyramid jutting out of the hillside. It was 75 feet high and almost free of \n",
      "vegetation. Right at eye level a hideous face stared back at him from the \n",
      "corner of the steps. \n",
      "The enormous empty eyes held him. Nothing he’d seen before could \n",
      "compare. The concrete and asphalt of Teotihaucan, the arid plains of \n",
      "Chichén Itzá—they were all silent, dead, obsolete. Something at Na \n",
      "Chan was still alive. He could feel the vibration through his tortured \n",
      "feet, through the skin of his wrists. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax said, “The last time we were here, it was fifteen years \n",
      "ago. All this was still buried, They really did a job, no?” \n",
      "“It was my brother,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“Yes, I know. I know your brother. Tomás.” \n",
      "“You never said anything.” \n",
      "The old man shrugged. \n",
      "Thomas’s camp had been in the square between the temples. Ma’ax \n",
      "Garcia had brought plastic trash bags and now the men moved through \n",
      "the area, cleaning up ten-year-old shreds of plastic and empty cans. \n",
      "“Does it bother you?” Eddie asked. “To see it this way, I mean? Put \n",
      "back like it was?” \n",
      "“No,” Chan Ma’ax said. “No, this is the way it should be. It’s almost \n",
      "ready now. Ready for the end.”\n",
      "74 lewis shiner\n",
      "•\n",
      "The Lacandones spent their first full day at Na Chan building \n",
      "two ramadas, thatched huts without walls, one to sleep in, one for a \n",
      "godhouse. They smiled and shook their heads whenever Eddie offered \n",
      "to help. Ma’ax Garcia had finally let him know how it was going to be. \n",
      "“So,” he said, as Eddie watched them trim the poles and set them in \n",
      "the ground. “Where do you want to sleep?” \n",
      "Yeah, okay, Eddie thought. It’s back to being the dumb white man \n",
      "again. “Where do you think?” \n",
      "“Maybe over here someplace?” Ma’ax Garcia took him off to a \n",
      "stand of trees in a corner of the courtyard between the Temple of the \n",
      "Inscriptions and the Palace. \n",
      "“Sure,” Eddie said. He had a good view of the serpent god, at least. \n",
      "“This’ll be great.” He would do what he was told and maybe eventually \n",
      "somebody would give him a clue to what was going on. \n",
      "That afternoon Chan Ma’ax found him while he was working \n",
      "on one of Thomas’s abandoned tents. It was a green nylon hemisphere \n",
      "with exterior aluminum poles and a couple of major rips in the side. \n",
      "But there were other tents in various stages of decay and he thought he \n",
      "might be able to put something together that would at least keep out \n",
      "the rain and the mosquitoes. \n",
      "“Come,” was all Chan Ma’ax said. \n",
      "Eddie got up and followed him. They took a path that cut between \n",
      "the two big temples. It led uphill for a while and then leveled off. On \n",
      "the right was a small pile of rocks that had once been some kind of \n",
      "structure. He couldn’t imagine putting it back together with anything \n",
      "less than a full set of blueprints. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax kept turning off the path and cutting across through the \n",
      "trees to another one. It didn’t take Eddie more than a couple of minutes \n",
      "of this to understand that the old man was deliberately turning him \n",
      "around. It gave him the idea that this was about the mushrooms. His \n",
      "palms started to sweat. \n",
      "Finally Chan Ma’ax led him down the side of a hill and through a \n",
      "narrow ravine full of weeds. And then Eddie saw them. \n",
      "Some of them were no bigger than the back of his hand, others \n",
      "nearly two feet tall, colored in reds and browns and golds. “They’re \n",
      "beautiful,” Eddie whispered. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 75\n",
      "They didn’t look like anything he’d ever seen. The caps weren’t as \n",
      "pointed as the psilocybin mushrooms in Texas, but they weren’t the per-\n",
      "fect spheres of an agaric, either. The skins were rough and knobby and \n",
      "the color reminded him more than anything of the sunburst finish on \n",
      "his old Fender Stratocaster. \n",
      "“These are the only ones,” Chan Ma’ax said. “They don’t grow any-\n",
      "where else. It’s because of the ground, you see? Sacred ground.” \n",
      "Eddie nodded. It was all in his brother’s book. Thomas had tried \n",
      "to transplant them and they’d all died. He’d tried to grow them from \n",
      "spores and nothing had ever sprouted. Eddie reached out to touch the \n",
      "nearest plant. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax snatched his wrist, hard enough to hurt. “No. These are \n",
      "not for you. The gringos and the ladinos that eat them go crazy. You \n",
      "understand? Very dangerous for you.” \n",
      "The old man was still holding on to him. “Why did you bring me \n",
      "here?” Eddie asked. \n",
      "“Because I don’t want you looking for them on your own. You see \n",
      "them now, okay? Now you know. Now you leave them alone.” \n",
      "Eddie stared at him. It didn’t make sense. It sounded more like a chal-\n",
      "lenge than a warning. “Okay,” Eddie said. “Whatever you say.” Chan \n",
      "Ma’ax let go of his wrist. Eddie rubbed it with his left hand. Jesus, the \n",
      "old bastard was strong. Eddie thought he was going to say something \n",
      "else, but he just stood up and waited for Eddie to follow him. \n",
      "But Eddie paid attention on the way back, making a map in his mind, \n",
      "and he knew he could find the mushrooms again. \n",
      "Eddie flipped the mosquito net up and got out of the ham-\n",
      "mock. He’d been sleeping in his socks because of the mosquitoes; even \n",
      "with the net they bit him through the bottom of the hammock. If he \n",
      "could get one of the tents put together it would have to help. \n",
      "He took the socks off and started for the trees. The Lacandones’ ramada \n",
      "was only a dozen yards away. Eddie wondered if Chan Ma’ax was really \n",
      "asleep, or if he was lying awake, waiting for Eddie to make his move. \n",
      "If he is, Eddie thought, let him stop me. \n",
      "His bare feet didn’t make any noise on the path. Once he passed the \n",
      "threshold of the trees he lost most of the moonlight. What light there \n",
      "was seemed to come out of the rocks and trees themselves. Mushroom \n",
      "light, hallucination light. \n",
      "76 lewis shiner\n",
      "He was trembling, a little. It had been a long time since he’d done \n",
      "any psychedelics. Balché was no substitute. He would, he thought, just \n",
      "go have another look at the things. They were beautiful. They would be \n",
      "something to see in the moonlight. \n",
      "He took the left-hand path and skipped a couple of the detours that \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax had made. There were noises in the distance, high up in \n",
      "the trees. The Yumil Qax-ob, the Lords of the Forest. Most of them were \n",
      "dead now, Chan Ma’ax said, or sleeping. Waiting for Cabracan to wake \n",
      "them for the end. \n",
      "He found the ravine with the mushrooms and sat down in front of \n",
      "them. If I eat some of this, he thought, not that I really would or any-\n",
      "thing, but if I did, I’d never find my way back. \n",
      "One of the kids on his brother’s crew had eaten a piece. He was \n",
      "down for the summer from Arizona State, a classic early seventies freak, \n",
      "wouldn’t cut his hair even to save himself endless hassles in Mexico. \n",
      "Somebody found him in the mushroom grove with red blotches all over \n",
      "his face and neck and chest. He was sweating like crazy and his temper-\n",
      "ature went up to 105 and stayed there, even after they packed him in ice. \n",
      "Thomas knew enough to give him Thorazine, but it might as well have \n",
      "been Rolaids. The kid couldn’t verbalize at all, just stared and clicked his \n",
      "jaws together. \n",
      "They got a helicopter to fly him out and after a week his parents \n",
      "came and took him back to the States. At the time Thomas wrote the \n",
      "book, which would have been 1975, the kid was still catatonic. \n",
      "Okay, Eddie thought. I’m just going to look. \n",
      "He leaned back with his elbows in the dirt. The caps of the mush-\n",
      "rooms glistened in the moonlight and Eddie could smell the damp earth \n",
      "they grew out of. The wind cooled the left side of his face and moved \n",
      "the plants from side to side. They looked like cartoon Orientals in coni-\n",
      "cal hats, swaying to some inaudible music. \n",
      "The wind died out but the mushrooms kept moving. Hypnotic, sen-\n",
      "sual. Beckoning to him. \n",
      "He reached out and broke a thumbnail-sized piece off the nearest \n",

      "he felt himself reaching out, being sucked into the spiral. \n",

      "It had started in London, when he collapsed right before going on \n",

      "And then, finally, he was lying in the dirt in the jungle.\n",
      "His arms and legs shook feebly. He stank of sour sweat and his \n",

      "The road climbed slowly through scrub brush to Chiapa de Corzo, \n",
      "where they stopped to take on a live pig. The pig’s screaming woke \n",

      "Just outside of San Cristóbal the bus hit a bump and swerved to \n",
      "one side. Through the loosely riveted metal of the floor Thomas heard \n",
      "the pig squeal in pain and terror. Lindsey woke up and stared at him for \n",
      "a second in confusion. The right thing to do would have been to take \n",

      "Instead the sight of her weakness made Thomas irritable. He looked \n",

      "as if they’d been packed in cotton. The sunlight was intense, but in the \n",
      "shadows the air was cold. Thomas closed the window as far as it would \n",
      "go. The wind whistled through the quarter-inch crack. He could see his \n",

      "She’s using you, he thought. \n",
      "The bus turned down into the valley. The town was laid out in long \n",

      "them. The buildings were Spanish colonial, white with tile roofs, and \n",
      "Thomas could see at least a dozen with arched porticoes. The streets \n",
      "were crowded with Indians on their way out of town. The Chamula \n",
      "men wore white or black tunics with embroidery and peaked straw \n",

      "alongside the bus. \n",
      "When they got to the station Lindsey said, “Can we get a hotel? And \n",
      "then maybe something to eat?” \n",
      "Thomas nodded and waved to a cab. Lindsey’s mood seemed too \n",

      "There were flowering plants everywhere. The perfume shifted his men-\n",

      "So she’s using you, he thought. How often have you ever gotten to \n",

      "And if she got Eddie back, all bets were off. \n",
      "They ate in the hotel. There didn’t seem to be any other tourists \n",

      "talked to each other. \n",

      "He shrugged. “Okay.” \n",
      "The office was closed, but the old man inside unlocked the door for \n",
      "them. He told Thomas there would be a plane on Sunday, two days \n",
      "away. “One of the Lacandones is in town,” he said. “Chan Zapata.” \n",
      "“Chan Ma’ax’s son?” \n",
      "“That’s right. You know him?” \n",
      "“A long time ago. When he was little.” \n",
      "“He comes up every couple of months to get away from his wife and \n",
      "drink a lot of cheap booze. He drank up all his money and he’s ready to \n",

      "Indians from Nahá is here,” he told Lindsey. “He’s staying at Na Bolom, \n",
      "Trudi Blom’s place.” \n",
      "“Who’s that?” \n",

      "“And this guy would know something about Eddie?” \n",
      "“If that was really Eddie in the picture, yeah, he’d know something.” \n",
      "“Can we find him tonight?” \n",
      "Thomas looked at his watch, strictly for show. Like she’d said, it was \n",
      "her party. “Sure,” he said. “If that’s what you want.”\n",
      "The mansion had a heavy mahogany door. The door was older than \n",
      "the Lacandones’ current troubles, but it was still mahogany. And it was \n",
      "mahogany that had all but destroyed the Lacandones that Trudi was try-\n",
      "ing to save. Thomas knocked on it with the bottom of his fist. \n",
      "Eventually a young woman opened it. She was heavy-set, with dark, \n",
      "greasy-looking hair to her waist. “The museum is closed,” she said in \n",
      "English. “We’ll be open at four tomorrow afternoon. The library is \n",
      "closed on Saturday.” \n",
      "“I’m Thomas Yates. I heard Chan Zapata was in town.” \n",
      "“Should I know you?” \n",

      "“He’s one of the Indians?” \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 87\n",

      "“Okay,” she said, a little dubiously. “Trudi’s in Switzerland, you know? \n",
      "I mean, I just work in the library. Why don’t you come in and I’ll look \n",
      "for...what was his name?” \n",
      "“Chan Zapata,” Thomas said. \n",
      "The library looked like it belonged in some European castle. The \n",
      "walls were lined with books, some of them in cracked leather bindings, \n",
      "some new, with dust jackets. Leather furniture was pulled up in a half \n",
      "circle around the fireplace. The fire burned so hard that the woman had \n",
      "to raise her voice to be heard over it. “I’ll be right back,” she said. \n",
      "Lindsey collapsed on the sofa and shut her eyes. Thomas wandered \n",
      "over to the last shelf and found The Lords of the Forest. He touched the \n",
      "binding with one finger. When he turned back Chan Zapata was stand-\n",
      "ing in the doorway. He wore a plain cotton robe with colored ribbons \n",
      "along the edges. The fabric had aged to a dull gray. He was barefoot. His \n",
      "hair hung down to the middle of his chest and he had the hatchet nose \n",
      "and sloping forehead of the ancient carvings. \n",
      "“Utz-in puksiqual,” Thomas said. It meant “my heart is good.” Mayan \n",
      "greetings always seemed weirdly formal to Thomas because nobody \n",
      "touched each other, even to shake hands. “You probably don’t remem-\n",
      "ber me,” he went on in clumsy Mayan. “I was in Nahá when you were \n",
      "just a boy. My name is Thomas Yates.” \n",
      "“I remember you,” Chan Zapata said in English. “But I practice my \n",
      "English these days. I will be a teacher in Nahá soon.” \n",
      "“Good, that’s great,” Thomas said. He moved onto the couch next to \n",
      "Lindsey. “Can you sit with us for a while? How is your father?” \n",
      "Chan Zapata took one of the leather chairs. He leaned back and put \n",
      "both his arms on the arms of the chair, as if to prove he knew what they \n",
      "were meant for. “He is the same, always the same. Sad now the road is \n",
      "finished and the mahogany is gone. But he tries not to show it.” \n",
      "Lindsey shifted and opened her eyes. She actually fell asleep, Thomas \n",
      "thought in amazement. “This is my sister-in-law,” Thomas said. “The \n",

      "“Hello,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "88 lewis shiner\n",
      "She held out her hand and Chan Zapata, out of politeness, leaned for-\n",
      "ward to shake it quickly and let it go. “Nice to meet you,” he said. \n",
      "Lindsey reached for her purse and Chan Zapata leaned forward again. \n",
      "“You have a cigarette?” \n",
      "“I’m sorry, no.” \n",
      "“Okay. The evangelistas say they are bad for me. ‘I need to cut down.’ \n",
      "That’s what you say, no?” \n",
      "He and Thomas laughed. Lindsey got the picture out of her purse. \n",
      "She handed it to Chan Zapata and said, “We’re looking for Thomas’s \n",
      "brother. We wanted to know if maybe you’ve seen him.” \n",
      "Chan Zapata glanced at the picture. “Ahhhh,” he said. “Eddie.”\n",
      "Lindsey put the picture back in her purse, and then held the purse \n",
      "closed with both hands. “You know him.” \n",
      "“Oh yes. He is a good man, your brother.” Something in his tone was \n",
      "a little off. “A hach winik. That means a real Maya, in here.” He slapped \n",
      "his chest. “He is your husband? I would not leave such a beautiful wom-\n",
      "an as you if I was your husband.” \n",
      "“And how is your wife?” Thomas asked. \n",
      "Lindsey shot him a nasty look but Chan Zapata sat back in his chair \n",
      "and laughed. “She is fine, Tomás. Very pregnant.” \n",
      "“Is Eddie all right?” Lindsey asked. “I mean, does he seem...I don’t \n",
      "know, crazy or anything?” \n",
      "“He is different from the other ts’ul, the other white people. He feels \n",
      "things very strong, you know?” \n",
      "“Intense,” Lindsey said. “He’s like that.” \n",
      "“Yes, intense. But not crazy, I don’t think. Or maybe yes. He is with \n",
      "my father now at Na Chan.” \n",
      "“What?” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“Na Chan?” Thomas said. \n",
      "“They are on pil … pilmigra...” \n",
      "“Pilgrimage,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Yes, pilgrimage. Most of the men from Nahá. All the most holy ones.” \n",
      "The sarcasm wasn’t obvious, but Thomas was pretty sure it was there. \n",
      "He wanted to hear the rest but it would be rude to ask. He waited to \n",
      "see if Chan Zapata was going to come out with it on his own. \n",
      "“Your brother is in my place,” Chan Zapata said finally. “Chan Ma’ax is \n",
      "very close with him. I think something is going to happen there. My fa-\n",
      "ther told me not to go. I think maybe now I was wrong to listen to him.” \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 89\n",
      "“So Eddie’s not in Nahá,” Lindsey said. “I should have known. How \n",
      "much farther is this place? How do you get there?” \n",
      "“Helicopter,” Thomas said. “Either by helicopter or on foot.” \n",
      "“Where do we get a helicopter?” \n",
      "“We can charter one, probably. That was what we used to do. Maybe \n",
      "we can even find the guy who used to take us out there, when we were \n",
      "working.” \n",
      "“You are going?” Chan Zapata asked. “To Na Chan?” \n",
      "“If that’s where Eddie is,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“I don’t have any money,” Chan Zapata said. “Not with me. But there \n",
      "is mahogany money that the town has. If you take me with you I could \n",
      "pay you back.” \n",
      "Lindsey shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me.” \n",
      "“Sure,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Can we look for this pilot guy tonight?” Lindsey asked. “I really \n",
      "want to get on with this.” \n",
      "Thomas looked at her to get a sense of what she was really saying. \n",
      "There was nothing obvious that said she wanted to avoid going back \n",
      "to the hotel, that she was tired of sex with Thomas. Still the implication \n",
      "was clear. “His name was Oscar. He leased a helicopter from pemex \n",
      "and worked freelance. I’m not sure how to find him. I don’t even know \n",
      "if he’s still around here.” \n",
      "“Oscar?” Chan Zapata said. “I know him. He goes to the Olla Po-\n",
      "drida. He uses the menses board there.” \n",
      "“Message board,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Ah yes, sorry. But if he is not there we can leave him a, uh, message.” \n",
      "Thomas was worn out from all the miles and the strong emotion. The \n",
      "heat from the fireplace was putting him to sleep. He made himself stand \n",
      "up and smile. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s do it.” \n",
      "Chan Zapata led the way into the Olla Podrida. He was like an ac-\n",
      "tor playing a Lacandon prince, Thomas thought. He projected a sort of \n",
      "innocent self-confidence. He made the tourists and students look out of \n",
      "place in their jeans and sweaters and running shoes. \n",
      "It was a good-sized room, with lots of light. The walls were hung \n",
      "with baskets and straw hats and embroidered dresses. Near the front was \n",
      "a cork board with dozens of scraps of paper pinned to it. \n",
      "“There he is,” Chan Zapata said. \n",
      "90 lewis shiner\n",
      "There was a lot of smoke in the air. Thomas saw Lindsey screwing up \n",
      "her face at it. They could hear conversations in four or five languages as \n",
      "they squeezed between the tables. \n",
      "Oscar had tilted his chair back against the wall. A woman sat across \n",
      "from him, her back to Thomas. She was leaning forward, like she was \n",
      "trying to keep his attention. Oscar wore a khaki shirt, desert camo pants, \n",
      "and sneakers. A pair of mirrorshades hung out of his shirt pocket. He \n",
      "had curly black hair past his shoulders and a day’s growth of beard. He’d \n",
      "put on weight in the last ten years, but then so had Thomas. He had a \n",
      "bottle of beer in one hand and a glass in the other. He raised the glass to \n",
      "Chan Zapata. Then he saw Thomas. \n",
      "“An old friend of yours,” Chan Zapata said in Spanish. \n",
      "“Thomas Yates,” Thomas said. “You used to—” \n",
      "“I’ll be goddamned,” Oscar said in English. His accent was more \n",
      "Texas than Mexican. He stood up and gave Thomas an abrazo that \n",
      "knocked the air out of Thomas’s lungs. “What the hell are you doing \n",
      "back here, man?” \n",
      "“That’s what I want to talk to you about,” Thomas said. He introduced \n",
      "Lindsey, and Oscar held her hand a little too long, looking her over. \n",
      "“I’d better go,” said the woman at the table. She was Northamerican \n",
      "and, Thomas noticed reflexively, nice-looking. She had brown hair to her \n",
      "shoulders, done in no particular style. Her eyes were hazel and serious. \n",
      "“Hey,” Oscar said to her. “This guy, this guy was my first student. I \n",
      "taught him to fly a fucking helicopter and lived to tell about it.” \n",
      "“We didn’t mean to interrupt,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“No problem,” Oscar said. It looked to Thomas like the woman had \n",
      "wanted more from Oscar, had been trying to make some kind of play. It \n",
      "hadn’t worked, and now she was dismissed. She picked up her purse and \n",
      "walked away. \n",
      "Thomas watched her go. His hormone production was way up and \n",
      "things seemed more dramatic to him lately. \n",
      "“Sit down,” Oscar told him. “Have a beer. You just saved me from \n",
      "some really boring shit.” \n",
      "They all sat down. Thomas knew Oscar’s macho act was making \n",
      "Lindsey uncomfortable. Him too, for that matter. As much as anything \n",
      "he felt embarrassed that Oscar hadn’t picked up on it. “We need to get \n",
      "to Na Chan,” he said. \n",
      "“Hell of a time to do archeology, I’d say. Shit, it’s almost too \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 91\n",
      "dangerous to fly over that part of the world. What do you want to be on \n",
      "the ground for?” \n",
      "“This isn’t about archeology,” Lindsey said. “It’s my ex-husband. \n",
      "Thomas’s brother. He’s there with some of Chan Ma’ax’s people.” \n",
      "Ex-husband, Thomas thought. That was something. Then he thought, \n",
      "cut it out. Quit mooning over every word and act like a grown-up. \n",
      "Oscar looked back and forth between Thomas and Lindsey. “Okay,” \n",
      "he said. “Sorry, I just thought there was something else going on here. \n",
      "I must have got it wrong. But what’s the rush? Won’t they be coming \n",
      "back in a couple days anyway?” \n",
      "Chan Zapata said, “I don’t know. My father is very strange these days. \n",
      "Ever since they cut all the trees. I don’t think he thinks he is coming back.” \n",
      "“Besides,” Thomas said. “Like you were saying, it’s a war zone out \n",
      "there. They’re not safe.” \n",
      "“And I’ve come a long way,” Lindsey said. “I’m not just going to sit \n",
      "around and wait for him to show up again.” \n",
      "“Okay, okay,” Oscar said. “I didn’t say I couldn’t do it, I just said things \n",
      "are bad. The guardia has Huey gunships up there, Italian fighter planes, \n",
      "all kinds of bad shit. You know why? ‘Cause the fucking cia told them \n",
      "the rebels had Mi-24 Hind helicopters, you know, those Russian plat-\n",
      "form things. Which is total bullshit, because if the compas had those, \n",
      "man, the pri would be history. But the guardia, man, those are some \n",
      "paranoid motherfuckers right now. They’ll shoot down anything, and \n",
      "the cia will give them money for doing it.” \n",
      "“Are you saying we could get shot at?” Lindsey asked. \n",
      "“That’s exactly what I’m saying. Because once we’re dead, they can \n",
      "say any shit they want. American citizens down here smuggling guns to \n",
      "the rebels. Believe it.” \n",
      "“Look,” Thomas said. “How much of this is real and how much is just \n",
      "to jack the price up?” \n",
      "Oscar shrugged. “It’s bad, man, I’m telling you. We aren’t just talking \n",
      "cost plus here, okay? We’re talking insurance. Because I can’t afford to \n",
      "do this too many times. And if the guardia shoots us down, money isn’t \n",
      "gonna matter to any of us anyhow. Right? You know?” \n",
      "Thomas put his elbows on the table. He didn’t like haggling, but it \n",
      "was part of life down here, and he knew how to go through the mo-\n",

      "“Two of you?” \n",
      "92 lewis shiner\n",
      "“All three of us.” \n",
      "“Round trip, in and out, I’d say five hundred US. Cash, of course, \n",
      "no pesos.” \n",
      "Which meant they would end up at three-fifty to four hundred. \n",
      "Before Thomas could say anything Lindsey cut him off. “I’ll pay it,” she \n",
      "said. “Whatever it takes.” \n",
      "Thomas banged his knee into hers and stared at her in amazement. \n",
      "She looked back at him like he was a little kid pestering her for ice \n",
      "cream. “You’ll have to take traveler’s checks,” she said. \n",
      "Thomas watched Oscar think it over, wondering if he could get away \n",
      "with some kind of phony surcharge, deciding not to push his luck. \n",
      "“That’s cool,” he said. “When do you want to do this?” \n",
      "“As soon as possible,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“First thing tomorrow, then. Come to the Aero Chiapas hangar out at \n",
      "the field. And we just hope the fog isn’t too bad or we’ll never find the \n",
      "son of a bitch. Six o’clock?” \n",
      "“Good,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“Well,” Thomas said. “I for one need some sleep. I’m going back to \n",
      "the hotel.” He looked at Lindsey. “Coming?” \n",
      "“I guess I am, aren’t I?” She stood up and nodded to Oscar and Chan \n",
      "Zapata. “I’ll see you in the morning.” \n",
      "They passed the zócalo on the way back to the hotel. Couples were \n",
      "walking arm in arm around the square, all of them in the same direc-\n",
      "tion. Lindsey slowed to watch them and Thomas waited for her. \n",
      "“They should go the other way,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“What?” \n",
      "“They’re all walking clockwise. They should go the other way. The \n",
      "clock is what’s killing them. Time, you know. It’s eating up their land \n",
      "and stealing their kids. It’s turning Mexico into one big Burger King.” \n",
      "“You can’t turn it back,” Thomas said. “That doesn’t solve anything. \n",
      "You have to go on, get through it, move on to something better. Trying \n",
      "to go back is stupid.” He started off toward the hotel again. \n",
      "“What’s got you so pissy tonight?” \n",
      "“You shouldn’t have just agreed when Oscar quoted you a price. You \n",
      "could have talked him down at least a hundred bucks, maybe more.” \n",
      "“So what? It’s my money.” \n",
      "“Are you rich now? See, I didn’t know that. Because if you’re rich we \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 93\n",
      "could have just chartered a plane in Mexico City and not spent all day \n",
      "getting here. Not to mention that Oscar now thinks you’re a soft touch. \n",
      "He’ll be hitting you up for money every time you turn around.” \n",
      "“Sorry,” she said acidly. “I thought this Oscar was supposed to be a \n",
      "friend of yours.” \n",
      "“He is. But this is Mexico. Friendship only goes so far. If you’re smart \n",
      "you don’t let it get in the way of money.” \n",
      "“Goddammit,” she said, “I’m getting sick and tired of hearing how \n",
      "bright you are and how stupid I am. I’m sure it’s the truth and all, but \n",
      "I’m getting pretty tired of hearing about it.” \n",
      "“I’m sorry,” Thomas said. “I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just tired, \n",
      "that’s all.” We both are, he thought, but he didn’t say it. \n",
      "“Right,” Lindsey said. She walked well away from him, arms folded, \n",
      "shoulders hunched against the chill. \n",
      "Lindsey showered first, then Thomas took his turn. The whole \n",
      "bathroom was tiled and there was no shower stall, just a plastic curtain \n",
      "that would have divided the room in half if it had been a little longer. \n",
      "The soap was hard and green and odorless. If there had been any genu-\n",
      "inely hot water, Lindsey had gotten it. \n",
      "He came out wrapped in a towel and sat on the edge of the bed. \n",
      "Lindsey was in front of the mirror, working on her eyebrows with a pair \n",
      "of tweezers. She wore a flannel nightgown with tiny flowers on it and \n",
      "had her hair up in a towel. \n",
      "The last two nights she’d slept naked. Thomas tried to tell himself it \n",
      "was the change in climate, fatigue, nerves. The infant in his backbrain \n",
      "wasn’t listening. It couldn’t see beyond the moment, and right now it \n",
      "saw everything slipping away. \n",
      "He kissed her on the back of the neck. She shrugged him off. \n",
      "“Don’t,” she said. \n",
      "He had this conviction that if they made love everything would be \n",
      "all right. If they didn’t it meant something dire, something permanent. \n",
      "He couldn’t tell anymore if he was in love with her or just crazy with \n",
      "testosterone. You’re blowing it, he told himself. Why don’t you lie down \n",
      "and shut up? \n",

      "She sighed theatrically. “Eddie doesn’t have anything to do with it. \n",

      "94 lewis shiner\n",
      "doesn’t put me in much of a mood, okay?” \n",
      "“Okay,” he said. He hung his towel on the bathroom door and got \n",
      "under the covers. He set his alarm for 5:00, six short hours away. It \n",
      "didn’t seem enough. \n",
      "“I mean, Jesus,” Lindsey said. “How can you be pissed off at me one \n",
      "minute and think I’m an idiot, and then want to screw me the next? It \n",
      "makes me feel like an inflatable love doll or something.” \n",
      "“I said okay. I’m sorry, all right? I’ll keep my goddamn hands to myself.” \n",
      "Lindsey walked all the way around the bed and got in on the far side. \n",
      "She lay down with her back to him, crowding the edge of the mat-\n",

      "He took his glasses off and put his hands behind his head. He wanted to \n",
      "kiss her goodnight or pat her on the ass or make some kind of affec-\n",
      "tionate gesture, just to cut the tension so he could get to sleep. To hell \n",
      "with it, he thought. It’s her move. \n",
      "Next to him Lindsey began to snore softly. \n",
      "They were up before dawn, packing. They didn’t talk to each other. \n",
      "Thomas got through it by writing scenarios in his head. Land at Na \n",
      "Chan by midmorning. Bundle Eddie up and be back in San Cristóbal \n",
      "by midafternoon. Spend the night in Tuxtla, Lindsey and Eddie in one \n",
      "room, him in another. Preferably not adjoining. He dwelt on that for \n",
      "a few seconds, just to see how much it was going to hurt. That early \n",
      "in the morning, as badly as he’d slept the night before, it sounded like \n",
      "something he could live with. Back in Mexico City Sunday morning, \n",
      "and home to Cuernavaca by afternoon.\n",
      "He saw himself saying goodbye to Lindsey and Eddie at the airport. \n",
      "It was right out of Casablanca, very pure masochistic bullshit. But \n",
      "there were times that it took hard drugs or bullshit or movies just to \n",
      "get through. \n",
      "The first words Lindsey said to him that morning were, “Are you re-\n",
      "ally going to eat that garbage?” \n",
      "The waiter had brought him huevos motuleños, a crisp tortilla cov-\n",
      "ered with beans, a fried egg, sour white cheese, green peas, and a lethal \n",
      "brown sauce. Thomas smiled at her. She was one move behind; it was \n",
      "already over for him. “It’s good,” he said. “You ought to try it.” \n",
      "When the taxi came, Thomas told the driver to stop by Na Bolom. \n",
      "Chan Zapata was waiting out front. He had a net bag with a towel and \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 95\n",
      "some magazines and fruit in it. His hair was tangled and his eyes were \n",
      "bloodshot, though he still moved with the same easy grace. \n",
      "Nobody talked on the drive to the airfield. They were late and the \n",
      "sun was already coming up. The streets were full of mist that drenched \n",
      "the taxi’s windshield and left gray streaks whenever the driver used the \n",
      "wipers. The Indians coming into town had plastic covers over their hats \n",
      "to keep them dry. Thomas tried to open his window. It rolled about \n",
      "halfway down and stuck. He could smell the damp and hear chickens \n",
      "waking up all over the city. \n",
      "The airfield looked deserted. The taxi pulled up in front of the Aero \n",
      "Chiapas hangar and Thomas got out. The walls were corrugated steel, \n",
      "rusted through in a couple of places. Two olive-drab Hueys were pegged \n",
      "down just outside the front doors. \n",
      "The inside of the hangar smelled like oil and metal filings. “¿Hola?” \n",
      "Thomas said. “Anybody here?” There was a door at the back of the \n",
      "place. Thomas knocked and then tried it. \n",
      "Oscar lay inside on a rollaway bed. He was wearing his fatigue pants \n",
      "and nothing else. There were lines on his chest from the crumpled \n",
      "sheets. “Hey, man, what the fuck?” he said, sitting up and pushing the \n",
      "sides of his face together. “What time is it, anyway?” \n",
      "“Six-thirty,” Thomas said. “You okay?” \n",
      "“Sure, man. It’s just early, that’s all.” He padded out into the hangar \n",
      "and stuck his head into a 55-gallon drum full of water. He came up \n",
      "shaking his head and spat a stream of water toward a drain in the con-\n",
      "crete floor. “Everybody here?” \n",
      "“Outside,” Thomas said. “Did you need to eat anything, or...” \n",
      "“No, man, after last night I may never use that stomach again. I’ll be \n",
      "right out.” \n",
      "Thomas got the luggage out of the cab and told Lindsey how \n",
      "much to pay the driver. A couple of minutes later Oscar wandered \n",
      "out of the hangar. He’d put on a T-shirt, a leather jacket, and black \n",
      "motorcycle boots. “This one here,” he said, patting the side of one of \n",
      "the Hueys.\n",
      "“Is it safe?” Lindsey asked. \n",
      "“Sure it’s safe,” Oscar said. “The aircraft is not what you need to \n",
      "worry about. Worry about the guardia if you want to worry. Did you \n",
      "bring the money?” \n",
      "Lindsey signed five hundred-dollar traveler’s checks and handed them \n",
      "96 lewis shiner\n",
      "over. Oscar stuffed them in his jacket pocket and opened the cargo \n",
      "door. “After you,” he said. \n",
      "“This is weird,” Lindsey said. “This is like a Vietnam flashback or \n",
      "something.” She and Chan Zapata climbed in and settled in the mesh \n",
      "passenger seats that folded down from the rear wall. Thomas handed her \n",
      "the bags and she stowed them under the seats. She reminded Thomas \n",
      "of somebody in an operating room, waiting for the anesthetic. She kept \n",
      "glancing around, but everything she saw seemed to frighten her more. \n",
      "He didn’t feel up to reassuring her. If she wants somebody to hold \n",
      "her hand, he thought, she’ll have Eddie soon enough. “Better strap in,” \n",
      "he said. \n",
      "Oscar untied the ropes that held the copter down and then climbed \n",
      "up for a look at the Jesus nut. Sometimes they cracked, and if they did \n",
      "the rotor fell off. Usually in midair. When he was satisfied he got in the \n",
      "right hand seat and took out a battered checklist. The lamination had \n",
      "almost entirely peeled off the paper. \n",
      "He went through the preflight settings on the switches while Thomas \n",
      "shut the cargo door and got in next to him. There was a duplicate set of \n",
      "controls on his side. Thomas put on a pair of headphones and adjusted \n",
      "the mike. \n",
      "“You want to take her up?” Oscar asked him. \n",
      "“No thanks,” Thomas said. “I’ll pass.” \n",
      "“Ready to crank,” Oscar said. \n",
      "“It’s all yours,” Thomas said. \n",
      "Oscar took the collective pitch lever in his left hand, twisted it, and \n",
      "pulled the ignition trigger. There was a shrill electric whine and the ro-\n",
      "tor slowly started to turn. As it picked up speed the turbine cut in with \n",
      "a sudden hiss. “You ever get to fly these days?” \n",
      "“Some,” Thomas said. “I’ve been in Cuernavaca, on a research deal. \n",
      "The people there have a little Robinson R22. I get to take it up \n",
      "sometimes.” \n",
      "Oscar nodded. He leaned forward for a look at the rotor disk and \n",
      "then pulled back on the collective. Thomas had forgotten the way the \n",
      "Huey always came up nose first. They hovered for a second while Oscar \n",
      "looked over the gauges, and then he shot them off into the sky. \n",
      "From above, the hills looked like crumpled blue-green con-\n",
      "struction paper. Shreds of mist were still tangled in the trees. The grassy \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 97\n",
      "patches of abandoned milpas were like some kind of plant cancer eating \n",
      "the forest. The farther they got from San Cristóbal the fewer of them \n",
      "Thomas saw. \n",
      "The hills got steeper as they flew toward the northeast. At first it was \n",
      "hard for Thomas not to watch the gauges instead of the scenery. As he \n",
      "got used to the noise and to the idea that he wasn’t doing the flying, he \n",
      "slipped into a kind of trance state. \n",
      "He wished he had music to go with it. Maybe one of the long \n",
      "instrumental tracks from Eddie’s Sunsets album, with the layers of \n",
      "strings over the pulsing rhythm section. He felt like he was sitting \n",
      "still in the air and the ground was being pulled under him from an \n",
      "endless roll. \n",
      "The radio snapped him out of it. Somebody was telling Oscar to \n",
      "identify himself. \n",
      "“Who is it?” Thomas asked. \n",
      "“White Brigade, probably,” Oscar said. The White Brigade was the \n",
      "anti-guerrilla unit of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad, the Mexican fbi. \n",
      "Even Thomas had heard of them. They were the local equivalent of the \n",
      "Salvadorian death squads. “Maybe it’s just a routine patrol.” \n",
      "Oscar told them he was carrying pemex engineers. It was, Thomas \n",
      "knew, his standard cover story. pemex let him moonlight in their he-\n",
      "licopter for a small kickback. It kept Oscar from doing it on his own \n",
      "for free. \n",
      "The answer came back garbled and full of static. “Did you get that?” \n",
      "Oscar asked. Thomas shook his head. “They say they killed Carla, that \n",
      "guerrilla leader, on Monday. They’re out looking for whatever’s left of \n",
      "her people. They want us the hell out of here.” \n",
      "Lindsey had gotten out of her seat. “What’s going on?” she shouted. \n",
      "“Nothing,” Oscar yelled back. “Sit down and strap in.” He looked \n",
      "over his shoulder to make sure she did it. Then he worked the foot ped-\n",
      "als hard and the copter dropped between the sides of a steep valley. \n",
      "“Bájale, ahorita,” the radio said. “Set down, right now. This is an order.” \n",
      "“Maybe,” Thomas said, “maybe we should turn back.” \n",
      "“No, fuck that.” Oscar turned a switch on the pedestal between the \n",
      "seats and cut off the external radio, leaving them with just the inter-\n",
      "com. “It’s a game, you know, a bunch of macho shit. They try to scare \n",
      "me off, we have a little chase.” They hopped over a hill with a violent \n",
      "up-and-down motion that dislocated Thomas’s stomach. “And then \n",
      "98 lewis shiner\n",
      "tonight I buy them a beer and everything is cool, you know? Just a \n",
      "kind of macho thing.” Sweat ran down his forehead. “Anyway, I think \n",
      "we lost—” \n",
      "The government helicopter dropped in front of them. It came out of \n",
      "nowhere, like a color slide projected on the windscreen. Then it turned \n",
      "sideways and the cargo door opened and Thomas saw the perforated \n",
      "barrel of a .50-caliber machine gun tracking toward him. \n",
      "“Ay chingado…” Oscar said. He wrenched the handle of the col-\n",
      "lective and shoved it all the way down. The engine throttled back to \n",
      "a whisper and Thomas’s breath caught in his throat. The helicopter \n",
      "lurched downward toward the trees. Thomas could hear the wind \n",
      "screaming through the torn weather stripping on the window next \n",
      "to him. \n",
      "It was like being in a car wreck. He reached instinctively for the con-\n",
      "trols and Oscar shouted, “Don’t!” \n",
      "He pulled his hands away. They were virtually in free fall. The updraft \n",
      "was turning the rotor faster than the engine. Thomas listened for the \n",
      "sound of branches under the skids, the last sound he would ever hear. \n",
      "Instead he heard his own heart beating, twice, three times. \n",
      "Oscar twisted the throttle back to full power and jerked the collective \n",
      "up again. The acceleration slammed Thomas into his seat and they were \n",
      "rocketing into the sky. Through his window Thomas saw the astonished \n",
      "faces of the guardsmen as their own machine fell nose down toward the \n",
      "valley floor. \n",
      "When they leveled off again the government copter was gone.\n",
      "Thomas looked into the back. Chan Zapata’s eyes were closed. \n",
      "Lindsey looked more angry than frightened. They watched each other \n",
      "for a couple of seconds. There was too much noise to say anything. \n",
      "Finally Lindsey looked away. \n",
      "Oscar rocked back and forth in his seat, completely wired. “Fucking \n",
      "guardia pilots, man, they’re shit. They go to school in Mexico, they fly \n",
      "like old ladies.” \n",
      "“Did they go down?” Thomas asked. \n",
      "“I don’t know, man. I don’t give a fuck.” \n",
      "They pulled out, Thomas told himself. We would have heard the crash \n",
      "if they didn’t. He looked for a second at the radio and then told himself \n",
      "he didn’t want to know. \n",
      "•\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 99\n",
      "Thomas knew they were close when he saw El Chichón, the dead \n",
      "volcano. It was twenty miles south of Na Chan. There was usually a \n",
      "faint plume of steam that came out of it in the mornings, making it a \n",
      "perfect landmark to steer by. The name meant lump or breast. It was a \n",
      "high, narrow cone, covered with trees right up to the diagonal slash of \n",
      "the old crater across its top. \n",
      "“There she is,” Thomas said.\n",
      "Oscar nodded. “Soon now.” \n",
      "Five minutes later Thomas spotted a white triangle just at treetop \n",
      "level. “There,” he said, pointing it out for Oscar. It was like seeing an \n",
      "old girlfriend. He was not prepared for the emotional impact. He re-\n",
      "membered the smell of the dirt, the sound of the parrots and cicadas, \n",
      "the pleasure of the work. The morning light seemed transcendently \n",
      "beautiful. \n",
      "Oscar brought them in right over the Temple of the Inscriptions. It \n",
      "looked better than he had any reason to hope. A few days’ work could \n",
      "bring it back to what it had been. \n",
      "Christ, what was he thinking about? They were there to pick up \n",
      "Eddie, and that was all. \n",
      "There were two ramadas in the main clearing, their palm thatches still \n",
      "green. Off to one side was one of the expedition’s old tents. Thomas \n",
      "couldn’t see any humans, but that was no surprise. They wouldn’t want \n",
      "to make targets of themselves for government gunships. \n",
      "“I can’t see any place to set down,” Oscar said. \n",
      "“Circle,” Thomas said. “There has to be something.” \n",
      "He watched the ancient city move beneath his feet. The temples of \n",
      "the Lion, of the Cross, of the Sun, simple stone rectangles with high, \n",
      "elaborately decorated roof combs. The Otolum River on the eastern \n",
      "edge that made a low falls where they’d gone swimming. The Northern \n",
      "Group, a single long base with three separate temples on top, where the \n",
      "summer kids had gone to smoke dope. The old landing strip, just north \n",
      "and west of the ruins. \n",
      "“That’s as good as we’re going to get,” Oscar said. “If those little trees \n",
      "are bigger than they look, we’re fucked.” \n",
      "It wasn’t much of a clearing. Grasses and saplings and cane plants \n",
      "covered the ground, but none of them were more than eight or ten feet \n",
      "tall. Oscar eased them down. Branches squealed against the fuselage, \n",
      "then shattered in the rotor blades. Pulp and chips of bark sprayed the \n",
      "100 lewis shiner\n",
      "windows. They bumped against the ground and Oscar killed the engine. \n",
      "It was quiet except for the fading chop of the rotors. \n",
      "Lindsey was out of her seat immediately, struggling with the cargo \n",
      "door. Thomas got out and pulled it open. Nothing seemed real yet. A \n",
      "single cicada screamed in the distance and then another came in, off key. \n",
      "The air was hot and wet as a sauna. \n",
      "Thomas held out a hand to help Lindsey down but she didn’t see it. \n",
      "She was staring into the jungle. She climbed down out of the helicopter \n",
      "and brushed at her jeans. Her pupils were dilated, like a frightened cat’s. \n",
      "Thomas supposed that he wasn’t really there for her. If she was thinking \n",
      "of anything, it was Eddie. \n",
      "Chan Zapata got out after her and smiled. “It is beautiful, no?” he said \n",
      "in Mayan. Thomas nodded. \n",
      "Oscar had climbed up to look at the rotors. “It’s okay,” he said. He got \n",
      "a machete out from behind his seat and said, “Let’s get on with it.” \n",
      "Only the edges of the forest were overgrown. Once inside there was \n",
      "enough room between the trees for them to walk. Oscar went first, \n",
      "chopping pointlessly at a hanging vine or two. Lindsey had a little \n",
      "trouble keeping her balance on the flat, mossy stones of the jungle floor. \n",
      "Thomas didn’t offer her any more help. \n",
      "He wanted to tell her that she was walking on history, that every rock \n",
      "that was making her slip came from a Mayan temple. It wouldn’t have \n",
      "mattered to her. Behind Thomas was Chan Zapata, who kept stopping \n",
      "to touch the leaves or look suddenly off to one side. \n",
      "They came out into the central courtyard. Through the high grass and \n",
      "the thin trees and shrubs Thomas could see the Temple of the Inscriptions \n",
      "and the Palace. The snake god grinned at him. He felt like he was walk-\n",
      "ing around on another planet, or in another century. It always hit him this \n",
      "way. He wanted to sit down in the dirt and look around him. \n",
      "Not today. Today there wasn’t time. \n",
      "The ramadas were deserted but the Lacandones had left mats and pots \n",
      "and food behind. They couldn’t have gone far. \n",
      "Lindsey stopped and cupped her hands around her mouth. “Eddie!” \n",
      "she shouted. There was no echo. The jungle seemed to swallow the \n",
      "sound. She called again and something moved by the big pyramid, com-\n",
      "ing out of the shadows. \n",
      "It was a Northamerican in jeans and a T-shirt. He walked up to with-\n",
      "in ten feet or so and then stopped. He couldn’t have weighed more than \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 101\n",
      "120 pounds. His hair looked like it had been cut with a lawn mower. \n",
      "He hadn’t shaved in days and his eyes showed more red than white. \n",
      "Well, Thomas thought, here we all are. \n",
      "“Hello, Eddie,” he said.\n",
      "A\n",
      "fter that first trip, Eddie slept all the way into the next \n",
      "afternoon. It was hard to finally wake up. He eased his legs off \n",
      "the side of the hammock and picked at the crud that had hardened \n",
      "in his eyes. The clouds overhead had already started to bunch up \n",
      "for the daily rain. Over at the godhouse Chan Ma’ax warbled some \n",
      "tuneless song. The words slurred together too badly for Eddie to \n",
      "make them out. \n",
      "His muscles burned and his head ached and he had the sort of all-\n",
      "over poisoned feeling he used to get from playing too late in smoky, \n",
      "boozy clubs. He thought that if he could just ignore his stomach a little \n",
      "longer he might be able to keep from throwing up. \n",
      "Somebody had left a clay pot of water for him while he slept the \n",
      "worst of it off. The pot was weird-looking. The ones at Nahá were \n",
      "rounded, with a handle that looked like a chicken head coming off one \n",
      "edge. This one had straight, thin walls, like a clay wastebasket. \n",
      "He washed himself down and brushed his teeth and put on a clean \n",
      "T-shirt and jeans. Just that much wore him out. He sat down and got his \n",
      "breath and then walked over to the godhouse. \n",
      "The Lacandones had unpacked the clay they brought from Nahá. The \n",
      "younger men, Ma’ax Garcia and two others, worked it with their hands \n",
      "on slabs of wood and then wrapped it in leaves. Nuxi’ and some of the \n",
      "older men worked up the basic shape, straight-sided pots like the one by \n",
      "Eddie’s hammock. At the end of the line, Chan Ma’ax ground up white \n",
      "lime to coat them after they’d been fired. \n",
      "The others had just about finished a kiln made from broken lime-\n",
      "stone blocks. They had a fire already going inside it and a stack of wood \n",
      "piled up close by. \n",
      "Eddie sat on the bottom step of the pyramid, waiting for a sign from \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax. He felt guilty, not so much for taking the drug as for being \n",
      "102 lewis shiner\n",
      "so obvious about it. Zonked out all morning, filthy and pale and sweat-\n",
      "ing. Everybody had to know. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax finally looked up. He glanced at Eddie for a second then \n",
      "went back to grinding the soft white rock. It didn’t look like the old \n",
      "man even knew who he was. \n",
      "Eddie heard the rain before he felt it or saw it, coming toward them \n",
      "through the trees with a noise like a press roll on a snare drum. He was \n",
      "obviously not welcome in the godhouse. If he stayed put he was going \n",
      "to get soaked. \n",
      "He started up the face of the pyramid. It was a 60-degree angle, and \n",
      "some of the steps were missing. He had to use his hands to keep him-\n",
      "self going. At the top there was a long, squared-off temple with five \n",
      "doors across the front. The rain was starting to really come down. Eddie \n",
      "ducked into the middle door. \n",
      "The floor was covered in dirt that had leaked through the ceiling. The \n",
      "ceiling was a corbelled arch, built house-of-cards-style with each layer \n",
      "sticking out farther than the last until they met over the middle. Thomas \n",
      "had made a big deal about them in his book. It was supposed to be the \n",
      "only kind of arch the Mayans had. \n",
      "The room smelled of animals, a musky, pissed-on kind of smell. \n",
      "Different kinds of grass and thistles grew out of the dirt on the floor. \n",
      "Eddie was a little worried about snakes but took another couple of \n",

      "dizzy again. He sat cross-legged on the damp stone and looked out at \n",
      "the city. \n",
      "Even through the curtain of rain it was really something. He could \n",

      "ghostly gray in the distance. The haze made the jungle look blue-green. \n",
      "Everything smelled clean, like water. \n",
      "He didn’t mean to fall asleep again but the hushing noises of the \n",

      "be one of the Haawo’.” \n",
      "Eddie started to freak. The old man wasn’t even wet. “You showed me \n",
      "those mushrooms. What did you want me to do?” \n",
      "“I told you not to touch them.” \n",
      "Eddie shook his head. “I didn’t believe you. Since when can you talk \n",
      "about this? About the Haawo’?” Even now it scared him to say it out loud. \n",
      "“Na Chan is a sacred place. Things are different here. Like with the \n",

      "“There was...” He realized he didn’t know the word for mantis. “An \n",
      "insect. Like a stick. With eyes that come out like this and little hands \n",

      "had stopped hurting and reality had lost its glittering edges. \n",
      "East of the camp and downstream, Eddie found a swimming hole fed \n",
      "by a ten-foot waterfall. He could barely believe it was real. The bottom \n",
      "of the pool was white sand and it was deep enough to be over his head \n",
      "in the center. The water was clear and cold and the rocks behind the \n",
      "falls were dark greenish-gray and covered with moss. The trees met over \n",
      "the middle of the river and kept it mostly in the shade. \n",
      "As he floated naked in the middle of the pool he found himself \n",

      "she liked. But she would love this one little corner of it. \n",
      "He couldn’t remember her face anymore, not all at once. But he \n",
      "could find bits and pieces of her: the fine golden hairs in the middle of \n",
      "her back, the way her nipples seemed to reach out from the ends of her \n",
      "breasts when they were aroused, the smell of her neck. His penis slowly \n",
      "climbed out of the water. He left it alone, too tired even to masturbate. \n",
      "After an hour or so he went back to the camp and spent the rest of \n",
      "the morning working on his tent. He turned up a repair kit and he used \n",
      "it to glue in triangular sections from two other tents that were too torn \n",
      "up for anything else. He lashed together a couple of narrow metal cots \n",
      "to make a decent-sized bed, and washed the mattresses in the river and \n",
      "left them in the sun to get rid of the mildew. \n",
      "When he started putting the tent frame together, Ma’ax Garcia wan-\n",
      "dered over to help. The rest of the Lacandones were out looking for \n",
      "food and copal trees, except for Chan Ma’ax. Chan Ma’ax was smoking \n",
      "cigars and finishing the new godpots. \n",
      "It took them half an hour to get the tent up. It was almost seven feet \n",
      "tall and 12 feet across. Ma’ax Garcia smiled and nodded when they were \n",
      "finished but didn’t want to go inside. Eddie moved in the double cot \n",
      "and his clothes and guitar. The guitar was still in the plastic garbage bag \n",
      "he’d used to bring it from Nahá.\n",
      "He took it out and tuned it and tried to play some of his old songs. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 105\n",
      "They only seemed to make him tired. Finally he put it down and \n",
      "stretched out on the bare springs of the cot. He had the window and \n",
      "door flaps open and there was a bit of a breeze. Civilization, he thought. \n",
      "Next he’d want a color tv. \n",
      "No, he thought, not a color tv. The only thing he wanted was to \n",
      "take the mushroom again. \n",
      "That afternoon one of the men came back with a yuk, a deer the \n",
      "size of a wolfhound. Everybody got excited. It meant meat twice in \n",
      "one week. \n",
      "Eddie had set up the tent so it faced east, away from the godhouse. \n",
      "After the sun went down the firelight came in through the screened \n",
      "windows and jumped around the walls. He’d brought the mattresses in \n",
      "and they were pretty comfortable. He could smell the meat cooking. He \n",
      "remembered that he hadn’t eaten all day, and just then he heard Ma’ax \n",
      "Garcia outside the tent. \n",
      "“I brought you some beans and tortillas. We figured you wouldn’t \n",
      "want any of the yuk, but you can have some if you like.” \n",
      "“No, this is good. Thanks.” \n",
      "Ma’ax Garcia went back to the fire. They were really whooping it \n",
      "up out there. Somebody must have brought booze. Eddie ate some of \n",
      "the food. He felt like he was spending a boomtown Saturday night in \n",
      "the slammer. \n",
      "He didn’t remember sleeping, but the next thing he knew everything \n",
      "was quiet and the fire was down to a red glow. \n",
      "He got up and ducked outside. He could smell woodsmoke and \n",
      "burned fat and the piny tang of copal. The copal always reminded him \n",
      "of the smell of rosin-core solder, like Stew had used when he worked \n",
      "on the band’s amplifiers. Eddie’s old Twin Reverb had smelled like that \n",
      "when he’d had it on 10 for a couple of hours and it got really hot. \n",
      "The Lacandones were sacked out in the second ramada, just north of \n",
      "the godhouse. The drunken snoring drowned out the insects. Nobody \n",
      "looked up when he walked by, but he hadn’t thought they would. He \n",
      "figured he was a sort of holy fool now, beyond reproach or help. \n",
      "The moon was low in the sky and there wasn’t much light. It didn’t \n",
      "seem to matter. He found his way back to the mushrooms with no \n",
      "problem. He stood and looked at them for a little while then got un-\n",
      "dressed. A mosquito whined past one ear. The night air touched him all \n",
      "106 lewis shiner\n",
      "over like a damp cloth. He sat cross-legged in the dirt where he’d sat \n",
      "two nights before and reached out to the nearest plant. \n",
      "New toy, he thought. When they were kids it was always Thomas in \n",
      "control, holding back, trying to be grown-up. Eddie was the one to fall \n",
      "obsessively in love. First with toys, then songs on the radio, then girls. \n",
      "He just kept after them until he burned out. \n",
      "He could see the scar on the cap of the mushroom where he’d bro-\n",
      "ken off his first piece. It had healed over, dry and wrinkled. He broke \n",
      "off another one right next to it. It was bigger than the first, though he \n",
      "hadn’t meant it to be. \n",
      "Lucky, Chan Ma’ax had said. Maybe not so lucky this time. \n",
      "Eddie chewed the piece of mushroom and swallowed it. When he was \n",
      "finished he lay back and looked at the stars. Na Chan was high enough \n",
      "up and far enough from the cities that there were a lot of them. After a \n",
      "while they stopped twinkling and grew rippling auras. \n",
      "It’s starting, he thought. Oh boy. \n",
      "It wasn’t just the hallucinations, or whatever they were. It was the \n",
      "whole package, the feeling of being out of control. He loved it. He rode \n",
      "the rush until the stars began to jump and spin and shoot past him. \n",
      "The bullets of colored light made flat, electronic popping \n",
      "noises as he fell into them. Behind the popping he could hear music, \n",
      "a guitar, the notes fast and guttural, played down close to the nut on \n",
      "the low strings. It took him a second to recognize it. It was himself, of \n",
      "course. The guitar solo from the last cut on Sunsets, an instrumental \n",
      "called “Roadwork.” \n",
      "The music leaked out of an oblong of red neon. It came toward him, \n",
      "afterimages streaking the darkness behind it. He could have pulled away \n",
      "but he didn’t feel the need. The blob of light glowed like an electric \n",
      "coil, its edges smeared with brilliant red. It swelled until it filled his vi-\n",
      "sion and then spun into tiny points of red, green, and blue light over his \n",
      "head. He made out the shapes of a darkened room through his closed \n",
      "eyelids. Then the eyelids themselves turned solid and he had to open \n",
      "them to see. \n",
      "He looked at the circle of colored lights again and knew where he \n",
      "was. Studio A at Electric Lady, under the middle of Greenwich Village in \n",
      "New York. The lights were mounted on what looked like the bottom of \n",
      "a flying saucer, hovering just below the 20-foot ceiling. Huge baffles cut \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 107\n",
      "the room in half. The engineers had put them there, Eddie remembered, \n",
      "to get rid of some weird echoes and some humps in the bottom end. \n",
      "He felt the weight of the Strat against his left shoulder, the head-\n",
      "phones over his ears, and, finally, the fretboard under his left hand. As \n",
      "soon as he realized what was happening he lost control of it. His little \n",
      "finger buzzed against the D-string and he let his hands fall to his sides. \n",
      "The rhythm track went on without him, unrolling from the inch-\n",
      "wide Scotch mastering tape inside the booth. After a second it barked to \n",
      "a stop. Gregg came on over the hum in his headphones and said, “You \n",
      "want to try that again, Eddie?” The tape was already screeching and \n",
      "howling backward across the heads. \n",
      "“Gimme a minute, okay?” He backed up until he found the stool \n",
      "he knew would be there. The Strat’s maple neck felt cool and smooth \n",
      "against his left palm. The strings were like spider webs, barely resisting \n",
      "his fingers at all.\n",
      "He pulled the headphones down around his neck and ran both hands \n",
      "through his hair. There was a lot of hair. For a second it felt strange, like \n",
      "he was a double-exposed photograph, one of him with short hair and \n",
      "the other long, one with a clunky steel-string acoustic, the other with \n",
      "the sunburst Strat. \n",
      "He wiped both hands on his jeans and ripped through the open-\n",
      "ing lick. \n",
      "In his mind he could hear the way the violins would come in \n",
      "around it in the final mix. The guitar’s sustain was sweet and strong, run \n",
      "through a Marshall head and a blown ten-inch jbl. The distortion gave \n",
      "it guts and heart, like the catch in a lover’s voice. \n",
      "“Yeah,” he said. “Let’s do it.” The drums had the lead-in, a stuttering \n",
      "press roll. Eddie knocked off three quick harmonics that decayed into \n",
      "feedback then slid down to the third fret. He bungled the fifth bar, but he \n",
      "knew the notes, his fingers knew them, and he was sure he could get it. \n",
      "“One more time,” he said. “Quick now, give it to me as quick as you \n",
      "can.” His head kept nodding 2 and 4 through the rewind. The drums \n",
      "came in. He had a second of nerves and then he was into it. This time \n",
      "he had it, letter perfect, right through to the end. He played on past \n",
      "where he knew the fade would come, letting the solo run down on its \n",
      "own. Both his hands were sweating and his right foot jerked spasmodi-\n",
      "cally against the rung of the stool. \n",
      "Finally he stopped and peeled off the guitar and leaned it against the \n",
      "108 lewis shiner\n",
      "amp. He was really jumped up. “You get that?” he asked. He felt like \n",
      "shouting. Man, that felt good. \n",
      "“Yeah, we got it,” Gregg said. \n",
      "“And?” \n",
      "“It’s good, it’s okay.” \n",
      "“Come on, man, don’t bullshit me. What’s the matter?” \n",
      "“I don’t know. Let’s listen to it, okay?” \n",
      "“Son of a bitch,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“You want to come up in the booth?” \n",
      "“Yeah, I’m coming.” He went into the hall and bought a Coke out \n",
      "of the machine. It seemed weird for a second that it only cost a quarter \n",
      "and came out in a squat throwaway bottle. His body felt wrong too. He \n",
      "was 190 pounds, the most he’d ever weighed. It came from Twinkies and \n",
      "Schlitz and White Castle hamburgers, too much sitting down and not \n",
      "enough all-nighters on the road. \n",
      "He stood there under a pin spot and swigged half the Coke. The \n",
      "sugar sizzled through his veins like a lit fuse. His right foot was mov-\n",
      "ing again, tapping out some inaudible rhythm against the orange carpet. \n",
      "This shit could make you nuts, he thought. But it tasted great. \n",
      "He took the rest of the bottle into the control room. The walls were \n",
      "paneled in light wood and the carpet was gray. There were half a dozen \n",
      "people in there already. Gregg and an engineer who looked like a biker \n",
      "had rolling armchairs at the console. The console ran for fifteen feet \n",
      "along the window that looked out on the studio. It had faders and vu \n",
      "meters for 24 tracks, though it was still only wired for 16. Dick, Eddie’s \n",
      "manager, sat along the back wall with a couple of girls and Anson, the \n",
      "drummer. Anson was hanging around hoping to get laid. \n",
      "“Let’s hear it,” Eddie said. \n",
      "The rough mix had the drums too high and the electric piano too far \n",
      "down. Eddie kept hearing the phantom strings that hadn’t been dubbed \n",
      "in yet.\n",
      "“I was thinking maybe some strings on this one,” Gregg said. \n",
      "“Sure,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“You okay?” \n",
      "“I’m having some kind of deja vu shit,” Eddie said. “It’s got me a \n",
      "little spooked.” Gregg and Dick looked at each other. Eddie hated it \n",
      "when they did that. Hated it when people wouldn’t tell you that you \n",
      "were nuts because they were afraid you really were. Then it hit him \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 109\n",
      "again, a memory of the future, five years away, sitting on the grass at \n",
      "Timberlawn.\n",
      "“You aren’t tripping, are you?” Dick asked. Dick was 35, a former \n",
      "lawyer with Epic records. His lapels were too wide and his sideburns \n",
      "too long. He had cranberry-colored double-knit slacks and white shoes \n",
      "and a white belt. \n",
      "“No,” Eddie said. He made himself listen to the playback. Everything \n",
      "else could wait.\n",
      "“It sucks,” he said finally. “The timing’s off or something.” \n",
      "“No balls,” Gregg said. “Nothing personal, you understand. But it’s \n",
      "got no balls. It’s not pissed off.” \n",
      "“Yeah,” Eddie said. He drank the rest of the Coke and threw the bottle \n",
      "in the trash. The trashcan was full of bottles just like it and newspapers \n",
      "and pizza boxes. He could smell the oregano from the leftover pizza. \n",
      "“I think maybe we should call it a night,” Gregg said. \n",
      "“No,” Eddie said. Everybody looked at him. He was suddenly cold \n",
      "and sweating at the same time. It has to be tonight, he thought. That’s \n",
      "when I did it. He felt like a train that had come off the rails. \n",
      "“Eddie?” \n",
      "He remembered the way it was supposed to be. He came in late. \n",
      "Lindsey was back at the hotel. They’d had another fight, a real barn-\n",
      "burner. He did the solo in two takes. The first was better but he’d hit \n",
      "the guitar so hard he actually tangled up his right hand in the strings. \n",
      "He could remember the rage, but he couldn’t make himself feel it. \n",
      "This is all real, he thought. I’m in my own past, and I’m fucking it up. \n",
      "Who’s going to finish the goddamn album? \n",
      "“Let’s try it again tomorrow,” Gregg said. “It’s three o’clock now. \n",
      "We’re not going to get anything else tonight.” \n",
      "Dick said, “Eddie was going to take tomorrow off.” \n",
      "Sure, he thought, the day off. He could make it up then, the real \n",
      "Eddie could. The rhythm of it was coming to him. “Yeah, wait, that’s \n",
      "okay. I don’t need a day off. But call me. In case I forget we decided to \n",
      "do it. Call me early, noon or something.” He saw the two pasts linking \n",
      "up again, a puzzled Eddie in the middle, wondering what had happened \n",
      "to his perfectly good solo. \n",
      "“I don’t want to piss you off,” Gregg said. \n",
      "Was I really this much of an asshole? Eddie thought. That people were \n",
      "afraid of me? “I think maybe it wouldn’t hurt,” he said. \n",
      "110 lewis shiner\n",
      "One of the girls stood up. She was thin and blonde, wearing battered \n",
      "jeans and a man’s sport coat with nothing under it. She’d left the lower \n",
      "button undone. When she stretched Eddie saw bare skin up to the bot-\n",
      "tom of her rib cage. \n",
      "“Want to do something?” she said. \n",
      "Eddie didn’t remember her name. Not that it mattered. He thought \n",
      "about Lindsey, back at the hotel. She’d have been asleep for hours \n",
      "now. Sex was pretty much a dead issue between them these days. He \n",
      "was pretty sure she’d been sleeping around, and God knew he had \n",
      "too. Besides which he was still pissed off from that fight he couldn’t \n",
      "quite remember. \n",
      "“Sure,” he said. “Let’s go.” He waved goodbye to the others. Anson \n",
      "had his eyes closed and didn’t wave back. Eddie felt like apologizing to \n",
      "him. Then he decided it wasn’t his fault if Anson couldn’t score. \n",
      "He took the girl upstairs in a freight elevator and let her into the \n",
      "spare room. Hendrix had crashed here while he was recording his last \n",

      "Now Jimi was dead and it was 1973 and it didn’t look like that new sun \n",
      "was going to come up after all. \n",
      "Hendrix’s people were halfway through turning it into Studio C. \n",
      "They had the control room walled off and glassed in. It made Eddie feel \n",
      "like he was under observation. Enough hall light came in around the \n",
      "edges of the door that he could see the girl. “Why don’t you take your \n",
      "coat off and stay a while?” he said. \n",
      "The girl smiled and took the jacket off. She was skinny enough that \n",
      "Eddie could count her ribs. Nice breasts, though, with pale nipples that \n",
      "seemed to look up at him. Eddie put his hands on her waist and she \n",
      "reached up to put her arms around his neck. There was an ugly bruise \n",
      "inside her elbow. Eddie wondered what she’d been shooting. Not now, \n",
      "he told himself. Pay attention. He leaned over to kiss her. She opened her \n",
      "mouth wide before his even got there, like a baby bird expecting a worm. \n",
      "He kissed her anyway. Her mouth tasted like cigarettes. She had an \n",
      "agile tongue and it did what it was supposed to do. His dick got hard. \n",
      "He tugged at her jeans and she pulled them off and lay down on the \n",

      "Her skin smelled warm and sweet. A strand of his dark wet hair fell \n",
      "across her cheek. He moved his hand down the bare skin of her arm, so \n",
      "lightly he could feel the goosebumps come up. “Unghh,” she said, and \n",
      "jerked her arm away. \n",
      "Eddie felt the anger come up out of his muladhara chakra. It seemed \n",

      "opening her eyes. She rolled away from him, taking the covers with her \n",
      "and leaving her back exposed. \n",
      "It was no good. Even if he did wake her up, she would come out of \n",

      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 113\n",
      "not music, he thought. It’s not sex, or love, if there’s a difference. So \n",
      "what is it? \n",
      "He was waiting to hear the click. The best dope was the stuff that \n",
      "slotted him right into the universe. It transcended words and everything \n",

      "Things would still be cooking there. Maybe even a jam at the Scene. \n",
      "He stopped. Something glowed at the back of an alley. It looked like \n",
      "men back there. Eddie squinted. They were naked except for loincloths \n",
      "and feathers in their hair. The one in the middle had tanned Caucasian \n",

      "like looking at a scrawny version of himself. \n",
      "He took a half step toward them, thinking, this is nuts. You’re walking \n",
      "into an alley in New York City at five in the morning. Do you want to die? \n",
      "He took another step. They seemed to get farther away instead of \n",
      "closer. He smelled garbage and old motor oil. He kept walking anyway. \n",
      "He couldn’t see the walls on either side of him. Then the three men \n",

      "He fought his way up through the bullets of colored light. It was \n",
      "harder this time. It took all he had. He lay naked in the dirt for almost \n",
      "an hour, eyes and mouth wide open, pushing air in and out of his lungs \n",
      "with slow, deliberate effort. Finally the pressure in his bowels drove him \n",
      "into the bushes. He mopped up after himself the best he could with a \n",
      "handful of leaves and stumbled back into the clearing. \n",
      "114 lewis shiner\n",
      "He couldn’t sleep. There didn’t seem to be any reason to close his \n",
      "eyes. So he just lay there. \n",
      "It was the heat of the sun that pulled him out of it. He smelled like \n",
      "something that had died. He got onto his hands and knees, tried to keep \n",
      "the blood from going to his head. \n",
      "He didn’t think he’d been there more than a few hours. It could have \n",
      "been days just as easily. It had been a catatonic episode, like he used to \n",
      "have at Timberlawn. \n",
      "For the first time he was really scared. A little physical abuse was noth-\n",

      "and exhausted and he couldn’t keep the tears from coming up in his eyes. \n",
      "I have to stop this, he thought. I really have to stop. \n",
      "When the helicopter came he was still cleaning up, standing in \n",

      "The others were already headed for the Temple of the Inscriptions \n",

      "Chan Ma’ax and crossed his arms over his stomach. He’d run maybe \n",

      "Chan Ma’ax shook his head. Of course he wouldn’t know any more than \n",
      "Eddie did. Somebody coughed and spat. The Lacandones all sat with their \n",
      "arms around their knees, rocking a little. The helicopter got quieter, then \n",
      "louder again. Circling. Suddenly the noise echoed off the hills like gunfire. \n",
      "“They’re landing,” Eddie said. \n",
      "Most of them had their eyes shut. Chan Ma’ax looked at Eddie and \n",
      "then closed his eyes. Okay, Eddie thought. He did it too. He listened to \n",
      "the insects and pretended he wasn’t afraid. It got to be like the moon-\n",
      "light, or the drug. He started to forget when he was. \n",
      "Then he heard his name. \n",
      "“Jesus,” he said. He jumped up, held onto a tree when everything \n",
      "tilted sideways. It was Lindsey’s voice. It was crazy. Just when he’d been \n",
      "thinking about her, had seen her last night in that hotel room. The voice \n",
      "came again and he started down the path, steadying himself with his left \n",

      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 115\n",
      "He walked out into the sunlight and Lindsey was there. So was \n",
      "Thomas. And Chan Zapata, and Oscar, the pilot from San Cristóbal. \n",
      "“Hello. Eddie.” Thomas said. \n",
      "Eddie could only nod. Lindsey stood in jeans and a sweatshirt, weight \n",
      "on one leg, pushing her hair back with one hand. She was five, six feet \n",
      "away. If he could make his feet move, he could go to her. \n",

      "“No,” Eddie said. “Can’t leave yet.” \n",
      "“What do you mean?” Lindsey said. She got close enough to touch \n",
      "him but didn’t seem to know what to do next. \n",
      "“Can’t,” Eddie said. “Not yet.” He had to stretch his face to keep his \n",
      "eyes open. They were all looking at each other the way Dick and Gregg \n",
      "had looked at each other. Run, he told himself. Get away, get out of here. \n",
      "He tried to stand up and fell in the dirt. \n",
      "It was afternoon. They were in the sleeping ramada, Eddie and \n",
      "Lindsey and Chan Zapata. The other Lacandones were over in the \n",

      "was confused, dislocated, and the sky was full of clouds. \n",

      "it apart and clean it out and everything should be okay.” \n",
      "“The radio still works fine,” Thomas said. “If worse comes to worst \n",
      "we can call for help.” He looked at Oscar. “Of course we don’t want to \n",
      "do that unless we pretty much have to.” \n",
      "116 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Because of that helicopter that...that crashed,” Lindsey said. \n",

      "“Okay,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“Lindy,” Eddie said. \n",

      "“This way,” Thomas said. “Be careful.” He started backward down a steep \n",

      "122 lewis shiner\n",
      "When she got to the bottom she saw she was next to a waterfall. Little \n",

      "back and then her stomach and swam to the sandy bottom. It was deep \n",
      "enough she could feel the pressure on her eardrums. She came back up \n",
      "and saw Thomas watching her from the bank. \n",
      "“Well?” she said. “What are you waiting for?” \n",

      "The stubble of his beard scratched her lips and chin and his hips ground \n",

      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 123\n",
      "his stuff start to run out of her and she held her legs together to keep it \n",
      "in. Not yet, she thought. She lay face down and pretended there was no \n",

      "Eventually she swam back to the edge and rinsed the mud and sand \n",
      "from her backside. She dragged Thomas out into waist-high water and \n",

      "out and put on their clothes. She reached out to steady herself on his \n",

      "“You could stay here.” \n",
      "He looked away, then down. “I’ll be okay,” was all he said. \n",

      "It was a little strange being the only woman with so many men, but it \n",

      "Lindsey ran. She ran all the way back to the hut and curled up in a \n",

      "“Shut up,” Lindsey said. Her voice sounded very calm and reasonable \n",
      "to her. “Just shut up and leave me alone for a while.”\n",
      "By the time they brought food Lindsey was able to eat a little of it. \n",

      "Lindsey feel crawly all over. \n",
      "She gave the last of her soup to Eddie and lay down again. She \n",
      "couldn’t stop crying. When Thomas tried to touch her face she slapped \n",
      "his hand away, as hard as she could. She wanted to be alone with it and \n",
      "knowing she couldn’t be only made it worse. \n",
      "Around sunset she found herself staring at a single green palm leaf \n",
      "hanging down from the roof. The sun gave it glowing red highlights \n",
      "and even the air around it seemed full of orange color. She was able to \n",
      "look at it and not think about anything. After that she could sit up and \n",

      "In a way it was like some kind of fantasy to be standing there talking \n",
      "to Hendrix and in a way it was the most natural thing in the world. This \n",
      "was where Eddie belonged. He felt more comfortable with Hendrix \n",
      "than he did with his own family, more than he had with anybody from \n",
      "high school. Which was why, when he turned 16, he’d dropped out and \n",

      "powder. For some weird reason they’d booked the show into the State \n",
      "Fair Music Hall instead of the auditorium downtown and the place was \n",
      "overflowing. There hadn’t been a major rock concert in Dallas for over \n",
      "two years, not since the Dylan tour in late ‘65. The pent-up energy in \n",
      "the audience was unbelievable. \n",
      "In the back corner Mitchell and Redding, Hendrix’s drummer and \n",

      "to tell which was which. \n",
      "Stew was there too, sweaty and Edwardian in lace and black velvet, \n",

      "maybe I could come on and jam with him at the end of their set.” He \n",
      "kept his voice down because he didn’t know what Mitchell and Redding \n",
      "would think about it. He didn’t want to piss them off and miss his chance. \n",
      "“Jesus, are you serious?” \n",
      "“I’m serious. That is a beautiful guy, man. I’m just telling you what he \n",

      "136 lewis shiner\n",
      "tour and then out to San Francisco to cut a record at Wally Heider \n",
      "Studios for Epic. The contract was nailed to the wall at Stew’s house. \n",

      "“That too, I guess, but it’s like this Indian word. Indian from India. It \n",

      "“Jesus fuck, Eddie, what are you reading now?” \n",
      "Eddie shrugged. “Think about it, okay?” \n",
      "“Yeah, I’ll think about it.” Stew stood up, shaking his head. “You’re \n",
      "really weird, Eddie. It’s a good thing you can play guitar, or you’d never \n",
      "get laid. Speaking of which, I’m going to go try to find some dope and \n",

      "Redding and then the three of them walked out together, laughing. \n",
      "The Soft Machine started up. From where he was all Eddie could \n",

      "hear was the bass, droning a two-note pattern, over and over. He \n",
      "opened another beer. \n",
      "Hendrix had left his guitars there in the dressing room. There were \n",
      "five of them, perfectly matched white Strats, strung upside down, with \n",
      "a peg for the strap on the short arm of the cutaway and the whammy \n",
      "bar so that it would dangle down over the bridge. Eddie touched the \n",
      "low E-string with one fingernail. It was like a steel hawser. He couldn’t \n",
      "imagine the strength in Hendrix’s hands, to play strings that heavy. \n",
      "When he turned around his brother was standing in the doorway.\n",
      "Eddie’s first instinct was to look for another door. There wasn’t one. \n",

      "shirt and a blue blazer and loafers. Between that and the tortoise-shell \n",
      "glasses he looked about as unhip as anybody possibly could. “Hey \n",
      "Eddie,” Thomas said. “Pretty shitty when a guy has to buy a ticket to see \n",
      "his own brother.” \n",
      "“What do you want?” He ignored the hand and Thomas put it away. \n",
      "Then Eddie felt like an asshole for doing it. \n",
      "“Maybe I just wanted to check you out. That could have been me up \n",
      "there, if I hadn’t quit playing drums.” \n",

      "“Couple weeks.” \n",
      "“Yeah. Like since Christmas. More like two months.” \n",
      "All the old helpless anger came back, like he’d never left home at all. \n",
      "“Don’t give me that shit, man. They threw me out. If they wanted me \n",
      "around they shouldn’t have done that.” It wasn’t that he hated his par-\n",

      "of his life. They were like quicksand, pulling him down. \n",
      "“They feel shitty about it. You know they do.” \n",
      "“So they drown themselves in tv. Last time I was over there the old \n",

      "“I want you to come home. Tonight. Right now. Try to patch things up.” \n",
      "“No,” Eddie said. “That was easy enough. Anything else?” \n",
      "“Listen, you little shit, I’m trying to help you out, here. Even though \n",
      "you won’t admit you need it. You’re going to be eighteen next year, \n",

      "His hands shook. What the fuck was he doing hanging around by \n",
      "himself in the dressing room? I am not going to let this bring me down, \n",
      "he told himself. He drank the rest of his beer, just to give Thomas time \n",
      "enough to get out of his way. \n",
      "In the hall the Soft Machine was a lot louder. The organ sounded \n",
      "like an animal being butchered. Eddie went out the fire door he’d seen \n",
      "Hendrix and the girl use earlier. They were probably in a limo in the \n",
      "parking lot. If they were through with what they were doing, maybe \n",
      "they’d take him in. \n",
      "It was like he’d forgotten it was February outside. The air was so thick \n",
      "and cold it bruised his throat as it went down. There was a loading dock \n",
      "right outside the door and he grabbed the metal railing around the edge \n",
      "of it. The cold came up through his hands and made him shake all over, \n",
      "like a wet dog. It sobered him up and let something out of the back of \n",
      "his head. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 139\n",
      "Jesus, that thing said, this is really intense. \n",
      "He wiped his face on the sleeves of his shirt, a black-with-blue-\n",
      "polka-dots number that he’d bought at Penny’s in NorthPark. The \n",
      "richness and color of his memories amazed him. He’d lost so many \n",
      "of them. Like the business with Thomas. He’d forgotten it, or at least \n",
      "pushed it aside. \n",
      "Instead he remembered jamming with Hendrix on “Peter Gunn” \n",
      "and “Red House” and afterward smoking Moroccan hash in the back \n",
      "of Hendrix’s limo with the blonde with the ironed hair. Hendrix had \n",
      "split and it was just the two of them, Eddie badly stoned and more \n",
      "nervous than he had been on stage with Hendrix. And then the girl \n",
      "casually unzipped his tight black corduroys and gave him his first blow \n",
      "job, and it seemed to Eddie like some kind of initiation, like getting his \n",
      "head shaved after sailing across the equator. He was transformed by it, \n",
      "knew that this, at last, was the Big Time, or at least the outer edge of \n",
      "it. Thomas and his parents weren’t connected to the Big Time and so \n",
      "they’d been written out of the scene. \n",

      "old self out of this just by being here, by taking his place, when he \n",
      "worked so hard for this. It was turning out like both the other trips, \n",
      "stripping his connections away from him, even the ones he wanted to \n",
      "hang on to. And still there was no click. \n",
      "He went down the steps to the asphalt parking lot, staying in the \n",
      "darkness between streetlights. Let me out of here, he thought. I’m \n",
      "ready to go back. He tried to remember the floating feeling that had \n",
      "come over him at the end of the last trip. He closed his eyes, tried to \n",
      "make it real. \n",
      "Nothing. \n",
      "He kept walking. At the far edge of the lot he saw something shin-\n",
      "ing faintly and his throat went tight. It was the three glowing men \n",
      "again. This is it, he thought, waiting for the pavement to dissolve \n",
      "under his feet. Instead they just got closer. He could see details now, \n",
      "past the shimmering effect of the yellow-green light. The one in the \n",
      "middle, the white guy that looked like him, waved Eddie on. He made \n",
      "big gestures with his arm, like he was throwing something over his \n",
      "shoulder in slow motion. \n",
      "Eddie started to run. It didn’t seem to make any difference. They \n",
      "looked like some kind of 3-D projected image, a hologram. Only it was \n",
      "140 lewis shiner\n",
      "like he was projecting it himself and so he could never catch up to it. \n",
      "His sneakers made weird, metallic echoes on the asphalt. It was a \n",
      "couple of seconds before he realized that he’d lost the streetlights again, \n",
      "that it was starting to happen like it had happened the last time. He \n",
      "started falling and he saw the bullets of light. \n",
      "This time he couldn’t stop. \n",
      "He was falling hard, hard enough to make his heart hammer at the \n",
      "back of his throat and his eyes push up in their sockets. The end of the \n",
      "tunnel of light had turned the same yellow-green as the glowing men. \n",
      "There was a pressure like a soundless wind against his face and shoul-\n",
      "ders and chest, and the feeling of blood rushing to his head, his cheeks \n",
      "swelling and his ears wanting to pop. He stretched his hands out in front \n",
      "of him, as if they could somehow break his fall. \n",
      "He’d read about life-after-death experiences. This was too similar. \n",
      "The headlong rush, the light ahead of him. Chan Ma’ax warned you, he \n",
      "thought. You kept kidding yourself you could handle it and now you’re \n",
      "going to die. \n",
      "He fell for a long time. \n",
      "Eventually time itself didn’t mean anything. He couldn’t tell if his \n",
      "eyes were open or closed, what direction he was falling, where his hands \n",
      "were. And once he realized all of that he found out his eyes were closed \n",
      "after all. \n",
      "He opened them to sunlight. He lay in a field of short grass, sur-\n",
      "rounded on all sides by limestone walls. Not the bleached, worn lime-\n",
      "stone of the ruins but smooth-finished limestone painted with warriors \n",
      "and gods and serpents. \n",
      "Just like when Na Chan was new. \n",
      "And then he saw the two men in feathered robes standing over him \n",
      "and knew, beyond question, where he was.  \n",
      "t h r e e\n",
      "T\n",
      "homas was sitting on top of the big pyramid when Faus-\n",
      "tino’s man found him. He’d spent the early morning cleaning out \n",
      "the temples with a shovel he’d found inside. Somebody, probably Eddie, \n",
      "had already made a start at it. With a machete he could have cleared the \n",
      "plants off the roof and sides. He didn’t see much chance of getting one, \n",
      "though.\n",
      "Faustino sent Righteous, the dark-skinned kid with the knitted \n",
      "tricolor Rasta cap. The kid started climbing the high, narrow steps of \n",
      "the pyramid and gave up after the first dozen or so, leaning on his gun \n",
      "and breathing hard. “¡Oye!” he yelled when he got his wind back. “¡Tu \n",
      "hermano!”\n",
      "It was something about Eddie. He started down.\n",
      "Faustino had been checking on Eddie for three days now. He had an \n",
      "old-fashioned leather medical bag with almost nothing inside. A stetho-\n",
      "scope and a blood pressure gauge with a cracked dial. That was about it. \n",
      "Whatever drugs he’d had were used up long ago.\n",
      "Thomas thought it was a waste of time. Eddie was gone, catatonic, \n",
      "like the other kid who’d screwed around with the mushrooms. Now \n",
      "there was news. The first thing, the obvious thing, that came into his \n",
      "head was that Eddie had died.\n",
      "When he got within ten or fifteen steps he said, “Eddie?”\n",
      "“Sí,” Righteous said. The kid was twitchy, moving to internalized \n",
      "rhythms. He left a pause after the “sí,” like he wanted to add “señor” but \n",
      "wasn’t sure of the politics of it. “He is awake,” he said in Veracruz Spanish.\n",
      "“Jesus Christ,” Thomas said.\n",
      "They had the flaps open, but the inside of the tent smelled sour \n",
      "and decayed to Thomas, mildewed. Eddie looked like somebody had \n",
      "let almost all the air out of him. Faustino was taking his blood pressure \n",
      "with the battered gauge and Lindsey was trying to talk to him in \n",
      "Spanish. She didn’t really speak any, but she’d been trying to learn it out \n",
      "of a book. Thomas supposed he had to admire her for the attempt. Her \n",
      "141\n",
      "142 lewis shiner\n",
      "clothes hung loose on her body and there were fatigue circles around \n",
      "her eyes. It didn’t make her any less desirable.\n",
      "“Hey, big brother,” Eddie said.\n",
      "Faustino made some notes on a piece of lined paper. It was almost \n",
      "filled with other writing and had turned brown along the folds. He put \n",
      "it and the stethoscope and blood pressure gauge back in his bag. “If he \n",
      "rests,” he said in Spanish, “I think he’ll be okay.”\n",
      "“Gracias,” Thomas said. Like with Righteous, formalities came hard. \n",
      "“Muy amable.”\n",
      "On the one hand the rebels were feeding them and otherwise leaving \n",
      "them pretty much alone. On the other they were hostages of a sort. Even \n",
      "though Carla hadn’t said anything to them about ransom demands. \n",
      "In fact, with the last-minute decision to come to Na Chan instead of \n",
      "Nahá, nobody knew where they were, not even Lindsey’s parents or \n",
      "Shapiro back at the project. It could be weeks before anybody even \n",
      "thought to look for them.\n",
      "Of course, if they were crazy, they could always try walking out \n",
      "through the jungle.\n",
      "Faustino nodded and left. Thomas looked at Eddie, lying there with \n",
      "his feeble, self-satisfied smile, and thought about how all of this had \n",
      "been because of him. And in gratitude Eddie had gone and eaten more \n",
      "of the mushroom. “You’re an idiot,” Thomas said. “You know that?”\n",
      "“Hey, man,” Eddie said weakly. “Don’t be pissed off at me.”\n",
      "“Why not? That shit’s poison. Literally. It could kill you outright, not \n",
      "to mention frying your brain. And you’re lying there grinning like you \n",
      "just won a goddamn marathon or something.”\n",
      "“Okay, man, take it easy. How long was I out, anyway?”\n",
      "“Three days.”\n",
      "Thomas was relieved to see that Eddie could still be frightened. His \n",
      "eyes seemed to pull back into his head. “Three days?”\n",
      "“They made you swallow sugar water,” Lindsey said.\n",
      "“Otherwise,” Thomas said, “you would have dried up and blown away. \n",
      "You could have died from dehydration alone.”\n",
      "“I took it before, you know,” Eddie said.\n",
      "“Yeah,” Thomas said. “We know.”\n",
      "“Twice before. It wasn’t that bad.”\n",
      "“Bullshit,” Thomas said. “I wish you could have seen yourself. You \n",
      "looked like death.”\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 143\n",
      "“Thomas,” Lindsey said. “C’mon. Take it easy.”\n",
      "“I can’t believe you’re doing this to yourself,” Thomas said. “I just \n",
      "can’t believe it.”\n",
      "He shut up. Lindsey was looking at him like he should have done it \n",
      "earlier. Finally he couldn’t stand it anymore and he asked, “What did \n",
      "you see?”\n",
      "“First it was just stuff from my life. The last time it was high school, \n",
      "and you were there. Remember the Hendrix concert? My band was the \n",
      "warm-up?”\n",
      "Thomas shrugged. “I guess.”\n",
      "“Then it got real weird and there were Mayans. Old Mayans. Back \n",
      "when this place was new and there was paint on all the temples and stuff.”\n",
      "It gave Thomas a chill. It was the kind of detail that somebody off the \n",
      "street wouldn’t be likely to know. Maybe Eddie’d read it somewhere. \n",
      "Most people thought Mayan ruins had always been plain white stone, \n",
      "like they were now. Most people didn’t know they’d been painted in all \n",
      "kinds of reds and yellows and purples.\n",
      "“Last time,” Lindsey said, “he hallucinated this whole scene in New \n",
      "York, back in the seventies.”\n",
      "“It didn’t feel like a hallucination, man,” Eddie said. “It felt like I was \n",
      "really there.”\n",
      "“Eddie, get real,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“I’m not bullshitting. The big guy there was named Chilam Sotz’. \n",
      "Where would I come up with something like that?” It was the right \n",
      "pronunciation, and a plausible name for a Classic Mayan priest. Thomas \n",
      "had no idea where he got it.\n",
      "“They were playing ball,” Eddie went on. “It was different from what \n",
      "you said in your book. There were a lot more players. Some could use \n",
      "their hands and some couldn’t. They had all kinds of different costumes. \n",
      "Some of them were naked. I watched for about an hour and then I \n",
      "went into the city.”\n",
      "“What was it like?” Thomas asked. “I mean, were you a ghost? Could \n",
      "other people see you? Were you just plain old Eddie Yates, only naked? \n",
      "What?”\n",
      "“I was one of them, man. I was in one of their bodies, anyway. Except \n",
      "he had real light skin. Not as light as mine, but light for them. And he \n",
      "had facial hair, a fuzzy kind of beard, like a 15-year-old’s or something. \n",
      "But he dressed like them and they didn’t seem freaked out by him—\n",
      "144 lewis shiner\n",
      "me—or anything. I don’t know what happened to the guy’s mind while \n",
      "I was in there.”\n",
      "“What about the city?” Lindsey said. “What did you do in the city?”\n",
      "“I walked around for a while. Everything was colored. I never knew \n",
      "that. The temples were all painted and so were all the statues and those \n",
      "column things...”\n",
      "“Stela,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“Yeah. It was amazing. And then this guy came and took me to one \n",
      "of the temples. It was one of that bunch over on the hillside, the one \n",
      "that faces back this way.”\n",
      "“The Foliated Cross.”\n",
      "“Whatever. They didn’t have names for them. The Chilam Sotz’ guy \n",
      "was there. He kept asking me questions.”\n",
      "“Could you understand him?” Lindsey asked.\n",
      "“Yeah. It was different from Lacandon, but not that much. Like \n",
      " Mexican Spanish and Spanish Spanish. I couldn’t tell him what he \n",
      "wanted to know. He kept asking about Muh-Shee-Kuns or something.”\n",
      "“Christ,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "“It’s what the Aztecs called themselves. It’s spelled the same as ‘Mexi-\n",
      "cans.’ The Aztecs—Mexícans—were just starting to be heard of down \n",
      "here at the end of the Classic period.”\n",
      "“So,” Eddie said. “You’re starting to believe me.”\n",
      "“How can I believe you?” Thomas said. “I mean, how can I?” He \n",
      "couldn’t look at Eddie’s face. “Go on. Then what happened?”\n",
      "“That was it. I was really tired and I just crashed out. It felt like I was \n",
      "out for a long time, and then I woke up here.” He yawned. “I felt kind \n",
      "of like I do now. Really wasted.” He smiled contentedly. “I really better \n",
      "get some more sleep.”\n",
      "Thomas saw that Lindsey had followed him outside. “You don’t \n",
      "believe him,” she said.\n",
      "“Of course not. You want me to believe those mushrooms are magic?”\n",
      "“What it is,” Lindsey said, “is you’re willing to believe in vague spiri-\n",
      "tual stuff, like God or destiny or karma or something, but you won’t \n",
      "believe in a mechanism you don’t understand.”\n",
      "“Like astrology.”\n",
      "“For example. How are you going to explain all those details Eddie \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 145\n",
      "came up with? Maybe there really is a rational explanation for what \n",
      "happened.” She put quotation marks around “rational” with her fingers.\n",
      "“I looked for one,” Thomas said. “I tried. I talked to all these ‘psy-\n",
      "chophysicists’ and all these other New Age science types. This one guy \n",
      "tried to convince me that memory is passed on genetically. He said we \n",
      "have all these ‘silent genes’ that we don’t know what they do. The right \n",
      "kind of drug could turn them on and open up completely new neural \n",
      "pathways. They think now that maybe that’s what acid flashbacks are, \n",
      "some kind of weird mental skill that we used to need when we were \n",
      "living in caves or something, that got called up by the lsd.”\n",
      "“But you don’t buy it.”\n",
      "Thomas shrugged. “This other guy tells me the entire universe is just \n",
      "a hologram. There aren’t any physical objects, just interference patterns. \n",
      "Then he says memory is holographic, and we all have the entire uni-\n",

      "mild surprise as the peroxide foamed up thick and white. Thomas \n",
      "kept pouring more on until the bottle was empty. He daubed the \n",
      "hole dry with a wad of gauze and then squirted some Betadine into \n",
      "it. He smeared it around with one finger and then wiped the finger \n",
      "on his pants.\n",
      "Porter sat through all of it without moving, his eyes barely tracking \n",
      "what Thomas did. This is ridiculous, Thomas thought. He was probably \n",
      "doing more harm than good. If the stomach or the intestines were torn \n",
      "up, he shouldn’t even have given him water. Thomas taped gauze over \n",
      "the bullet hole and stood up.\n",
      "Porter’s arm hung out in plain view. Thomas moved it against the \n",
      "man’s side and pulled a tree limb next to it for camouflage.\n",
      "A fly was already poking at a caramel-colored smear of Betadine at \n",
      "the edge of the bandage. Hopeless, Thomas thought. A chunk of dried \n",
      "mucus had formed in the corner of Porter’s right eye and Thomas re-\n",
      "sisted the urge to brush it away. Porter seemed even worse off than he \n",
      "had two hours before.\n",
      "“Guh,” Porter said. “Guh.” Then his face wrinkled up like he was \n",
      "going to scream and Thomas got out the needle. He pinched up some \n",
      "loose skin on Porter’s arm and poked the needle in, holding it by the \n",
      "shaft like a dart. He pushed down the plunger. Oscar had been amazed \n",
      "that the morphine was still in the kit. If the rebels had found the mor-\n",
      "phine, though, they would have taken everything else with it.\n",
      "He left about half the morphine in the syringe and put the plastic \n",
      "cap over the needle. His hands shook. He stuffed everything into one of \n",
      "Porter’s pockets and stood up to go.\n",
      "The sound of voices dropped him back to his knees.\n",
      "“You okay?” he heard Lindsey say.\n",
      "“Yeah.” Eddie’s voice.\n",
      "“Be careful.”\n",
      "Thomas watched them climb down the slope. Once they both had \n",
      "their backs turned Thomas faded deeper into the forest. He kept his feet \n",
      "on the rocks so he wouldn’t make any noise.\n",
      "He knew even then he could have said something. He had as much \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 155\n",
      "business there as they did. But seeing them together gave him a knotted \n",
      "up feeling inside and he wanted to watch what happened next.\n",
      "Eddie sat down at the bottom of the cliff. “Let me rest a minute,” \n",
      "he said. The water reflected his voice cleanly, making him sound closer \n",
      "than he was. Lindsey walked up to the edge of the pool and started to \n",
      "unbutton her shirt.\n",
      "It was like watching an accident. Thomas could not look away. She \n",
      "turned to drop her shirt and Thomas saw ragged spots of sunlight touch \n",
      "her small, soft breasts. The sun was almost straight overhead. She took off \n",
      "her jeans and hopped for a second on one leg. There was a pretense of \n",
      "shyness in the way she stood with her back to Eddie but Thomas didn’t \n",
      "believe in it. She skimmed off her underpants and dived in the water.\n",
      "She splashed for a few seconds and then rolled over on her back. Her \n",
      "nipples were tight from the coolness of the water. From this distance she \n",
      "was streamlined, perfect, like a picture in a magazine. “Come on,” she \n",
      "said to Eddie. “It feels wonderful.”\n",
      "Eddie waded into the pool. He was wearing cutoffs and a T-shirt and \n",
      "no shoes. With his spiky hair he looked like a little kid. After a minute \n",
      "he took off the shirt but left the shorts on.\n",
      "Good for you, Thomas thought. Then he thought, listen to me. What am \n",
      "I doing here, anyway? I should get out now, before this really turns ugly.\n",
      "Eddie sat in the shallow water, leaning back until it came up under his \n",
      "chin. Lindsey swam over and pulled him into the middle of the pool. Eddie \n",
      "was painfully thin and Thomas could see him shivering from the chill.\n",
      "After a while they got out. There was a little scrap of beach there. It \n",
      "was inevitable and horrible, like a rerun of some badly made movie on \n",
      "tv. Thomas knew what was going to happen and it made him a little \n",
      "sick. But it didn’t seem real enough to get up and walk away from.\n",
      "Eddie stood in the sand while Lindsey knelt and peeled his shorts \n",
      "down to his feet. His erection looked like an obscene practical joke, a \n",
      "dildo hung on a lab skeleton. Lindsey took it in her mouth.\n",
      "Thomas sat down in the leaves. He made a little noise doing it but \n",
      "it hardly mattered in the circumstances. He paid careful attention to \n",
      "everything he saw. It was, after all, not the sort of thing most men got to \n",
      "watch. His blood felt very, very cold, but other than that he was focused \n",
      "and alert.\n",
      "Lindsey held on to Eddie’s hands and pulled him toward her as she lay \n",
      "back in the sand. Neither of them said anything, for which Thomas was \n",
      "156 lewis shiner\n",
      "grateful. Eddie dropped to one knee. He planted his elbows on either \n",
      "side of her rib cage and kissed her on the mouth. She kissed him back \n",
      "and then she pulled his head away and moved it down to her chest. He \n",
      "took one nipple in his teeth and pulled on it, stretching the loose skin \n",
      "of her breast into an isosceles triangle. When Thomas had made love \n",
      "to her in Mexico City, just a week ago, she had moved his head to the \n",
      "same breast, the left one.\n",
      "Toward the end Lindsey seemed to forget where she was. She thrashed \n",
      "her head from side to side and her breathing was very loud. Thomas got \n",
      "up and walked away, back toward the helicopter and the camp.\n",
      "Thomas climbed the Temple of the Inscriptions, thinking he would \n",
      "work until supper. He went up on the collapsed roof, pulling out fallen \n",
      "slabs, using the handle of the shovel as a lever. So he was outside, where \n",
      "he could see, when Lindsey and Eddie came back into camp. They were \n",
      "holding hands. He watched them go into Eddie’s tent and then he bent \n",
      "over the shovel again.\n",
      "Around four o’clock, after the rain, Chan Zapata came to help him. \n",
      "He was stripped down to his loincloth and had, miraculously, a machete.\n",
      "“They let you keep that?” Thomas asked.\n",
      "“Lacandones don’t make trouble. They like to get drunk, and some-\n",
      "times they argue with each other, but they don’t make trouble.” Thomas \n",
      "couldn’t tell if he was being sarcastic or not. “All the world knows this.”\n",
      "The next time Thomas looked down, Carla was watching. Somehow \n",
      "she’d gotten a folding aluminum lounge chair with red and yellow and \n",
      "green plastic webbing. The contrast with her khaki shirt and black beret \n",
      "and rifle was more strange than it was funny.\n",
      "After a while she sent Gonzales, the fat man with the mustache, up to \n",
      "where they were working. She hadn’t let him bring his rifle and Thom-\n",
      "as had seen him argue with her about it. When he finally got to the top \n",
      "of the pyramid he was sweating and angry.\n",
      "“Carla says to help you,” he told Thomas. “You stupid gabacho cabrón. \n",
      "What are you trying to do up here?”\n",
      "Thomas let Gonzales hold the smaller pieces of the arch in place while \n",
      "he and Chan Zapata set the capstones. It was easy work, but Gonzales \n",
      "never stopped complaining. When Thomas said they were finished, he \n",
      "spat and shook his head and hurried back down to the ground.\n",
      "There was a long hour of twilight between the time the sun went \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 157\n",
      "into the trees and the time it actually set behind El Chich6n. Thomas sat \n",
      "with Chan Zapata, swatting mosquitoes. They watched the rebels come \n",
      "back into camp, a few of them with food.\n",
      "“Beautiful, no?” Chan Zapata said, holding both hands out to the jungle.\n",
      "Thomas nodded. To hell with her, he thought. He could manage all \n",
      "right on his own.\n",
      "Every night there were one or two more for supper. The \n",
      "Lacandones ate in the godhouse, and in the other ramada it was Thomas \n",
      "and Lindsey and Oscar, plus Carla and Faustino and a self-important \n",
      "little man named Ramos. Tonight there were six other rebels as well. \n",
      "Thomas understood it was some kind of reward for good hunting or \n",
      "bravery or political correctness.\n",
      "Eddie had gone to eat with the Lacandones. Either he’d told Lindsey \n",
      "she wasn’t welcome or she’d decided for herself to face Thomas without \n",
      "him. She sat next to Thomas but kept her distance.\n",
      "“There is much news today,” Ramos announced in Spanish. “It has \n",
      "been found out that your country secretly sold arms to Iran. It was part \n",
      "of a very complicated trade to get hostages out of Beirut. Your President \n",
      "is greatly embarrassed. How does this make you feel?”\n",
      "Thomas shrugged. It didn’t seem any worse than the usual govern-\n",
      "ment lying and meddling. “I try to stay out of politics.”\n",
      "“I’m sorry,” Ramos said, “but that isn’t really a choice for you any-\n",
      "more. Politics has arrived in your life. Here we are, no?”\n",
      "They all sat on mats and ate with their fingers. There was a big pot of \n",
      "roasted bird meat, maybe some kind of wild duck, and tortillas. The hard \n",
      "work had left Thomas hungry, but being next to Lindsey had made his \n",
      "stomach close up. Every time he looked at her he saw her with her eyes \n",
      "closed, her hair whipping back and forth.\n",
      "“What about us?” Oscar asked. “What’s it going to take for you to let \n",
      "us go?”\n",
      "“We’ve told you,” Ramos said. “You’re not hostages. It’s just necessary \n",
      "for us to keep you here for a few more days.”\n",
      "“Right,” Oscar said.\n",
      "“Of course, if you wanted to cooperate in the matter of the helicop-\n",
      "ter we could all be out of here that much sooner.”\n",
      "“Kiss my ass,” Oscar said.\n",
      "Ramos got very flushed and it looked like he was going to reach over \n",
      "158 lewis shiner\n",
      "and slap Oscar, if not shoot him. Carla stared somewhere between the \n",
      "two of them, her eyes dark and very Indian-looking. She was afraid, \n",
      "Thomas realized. He remembered what Oscar had said about how frag-\n",
      "ile her control was. She wasn’t going to stand up to Ramos. If there was \n",
      "trouble, Thomas didn’t know where it would stop.\n",
      "“Can I have a tortilla?” Lindsey said.\n",
      "Ramos looked at her and then back at Oscar. He handed her the \n",
      "green plastic plate of tortillas and the tension broke.\n",
      "Thomas ate what he could. Ramos and Carla talked about the Iran \n",
      "arms deal and what it meant. The conversation was stiff and sounded \n",
      "like they’d rehearsed it. They disagreed on almost everything. Carla \n",
      "thought it would make the US back off a little from Central America \n",
      "and Ramos thought it would make things worse. The argument ended \n",
      "up, as usual, in Nicaragua. Ramos had a long list of statistics to prove \n",
      "how the Sandinistas were responsible for the only economic growth \n",
      "in the region. Carla thought the revolution had been betrayed. It was \n",
      "pretty dry stuff, altogether.\n",
      "Thomas thought about what it would do to them to know about the \n",
      "wounded soldier. He kept trying to get Oscar to look at him. Finally \n",
      "they locked eyes and after a couple of seconds Oscar nodded yes, he \n",
      "would do it.\n",
      "Thomas began to get scared.\n",
      "After dinner, when the rebels had all wandered off, Thomas \n",
      "changed into a black long-sleeved shirt from his suitcase. He tossed Os-\n",
      "car a navy blue sweater.\n",
      "“Hey, great, man,” Oscar said. “We going to put black shit under our \n",
      "eyes, too, like real commandos?”\n",
      "Thomas said, “Let’s get it over with. We can get it done and get back be-\n",
      "fore anybody notices.” Just talking about it being over made him feel better.\n",
      "“Whatever,” Oscar said. “Don’t forget this was your idea, man.”\n",
      "They took towels and a flashlight down to the river like they were \n",
      "going to wash up. Nobody seemed to care. Once they were out of sight \n",
      "of the camp they cut back to the helicopter and got the stretcher. Every \n",
      "pop and rustle in the forest sent Thomas’s pulse off in another direction.\n",
      "Thomas timed them as they walked from the helicopter to the falls. \n",
      "Eight minutes. A loaded stretcher couldn’t do worse than double it. Half \n",
      "an hour from now, he told himself, everything is going to be fine.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 159\n",
      "Oscar set the stretcher down next to the body and unrolled it. Thomas \n",
      "masked the flashlight with his fingers before he turned it on.\n",
      "“Jesus,” Oscar said.\n",
      "Thomas fumbled with Porter’s wrist. Porter jerked it away before he \n",
      "could find a pulse. “He’s alive, anyway,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“Water,” Porter said.\n",
      "Thomas took the folding cup down to the pool. He stood where \n",
      "Eddie and Lindsey had been going at it. He squatted down to scoop out \n",
      "the water. He thought he could see the faint impression of Lindsey’s ass \n",
      "still in the sand.\n",
      "The moonlight seemed bright as day. Everything was intense. He felt \n",
      "like there was a freight train inside him, driving him on.\n",
      "Instead of taking the water straight back to Porter he went to the \n",
      "bush where he’d left the M16. Just to see if it was still there. He set the \n",
      "water and flashlight down and felt around in the leaves with both hands. \n",
      "His fingers touched hard plastic.\n",
      "He must have known what he was going to do. Once he had the \n",
      "gun in his hands he couldn’t leave it behind. It was a bad idea whose \n",
      "time had come. He slung the strap over his shoulder and took the \n",
      "water to Porter.\n",
      "Oscar looked up and saw the gun. “What the fuck are you doing? \n",
      "Where did you get that?”\n",
      "Thomas knelt and tried to feed Porter the water. “It’s his,” he said.\n",
      "“Are you crazy? Get rid of it.”\n",
      "“No,” Thomas said. Porter could barely swallow. Most of the water \n",
      "ran down his face and neck.\n",
      "“All you’re going to do is get us both shot.”\n",
      "“If they find us,” Thomas said, “carrying this guy on a stretcher in the \n",
      "jungle in the middle of the night, they’re going to start shooting any-\n",
      "way. This could buy us some time, keep their heads down so they don’t \n",
      "recognize us.”\n",
      "“Fucking guns,” Oscar said. “You’re just another cowboy, like all the \n",
      "others.”\n",
      "They stared at each other in the moonlight. Thomas thought about \n",
      "how much he hated Oscar right then. He couldn’t imagine not hating \n",
      "him. The hatred, like everything else, was vivid as lightning. He could \n",
      "taste it in the back of his throat.\n",
      "“Let’s do it,” Oscar said. “Just get it over with.”\n",
      "160 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Okay,” Thomas said. He took Porter’s shoulders and Oscar took his \n",
      "feet and they lifted him onto the stretcher. The gun slipped off Thomas’s \n",
      "shoulder and rasped in the dirt as he struggled with the dying man’s \n",
      "weight. Porter sagged in the middle as they carried him and Thomas \n",
      "imagined he could hear the wound tearing open.\n",
      "He slung the rifle again and grabbed the handles of the stretcher. \n",
      "Oscar turned his back and picked up his end. “Go,” he said, and Thomas \n",
      "straightened up.\n",
      "The weight was worse than he’d imagined. His muscles burned from \n",
      "the long afternoon of work, from not enough food. He thought about \n",
      "not being able to eat at dinner and that made him think about Lindsey. \n",
      "He got a little crazy then and didn’t care what happened to him.\n",
      "They made a lot of noise getting down to the riverbank. Then Os-\n",
      "car missed the end of the path and they had to back up and look for it. \n",
      "Once they found it and got into the trees the darkness was absolute.\n",
      "“I have to have the flashlight,” Oscar said.\n",
      "“Yeah, okay,” Thomas said.\n",
      "They set Porter down. Oscar tucked the flashlight in his armpit and \n",
      "they started off again, following the circle of yellow light. Thomas won-\n",
      "dered how far away somebody could see it. He had nothing to do but go \n",
      "where the stretcher pulled him and it gave him too much time to think.\n",
      "The worst was that he kept tripping over rocks and branches in the \n",
      "path. Not badly enough to go down, but every time it happened it sent \n",
      "a jolt up through his aching arms and legs and made his glasses bounce. \n",
      "He couldn’t see his watch. It was just as well. He knew the hands \n",
      "wouldn’t even seem to be moving.\n",
      "He thought about what he was going to do when he got out of this. \n",
      "Go back to the States, to start with. He might have been able to put up \n",
      "with Espinosa before, but Carla and Ramos had soured him on petty \n",
      "tyranny. He’d lost his taste for it. If he could get something—anything—\n",
      "out of Chan Ma’ax, he could write a new grant proposal and take it \n",
      "back to ut in Austin. Where there were winters and it even snowed \n",
      "sometimes. Where they had Tex-Mex food, tamales and ground beef \n",
      "tacos like they didn’t have on this side of the border. Magazines. Warner \n",
      "Brothers cartoons every Saturday morning that he could watch in his \n",
      "air-conditioned bedroom from his queen-sized bed.\n",
      "They must have gotten onto the wrong path. It couldn’t possibly be \n",
      "taking this long. He couldn’t feel his hands anymore. He kept watching \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 161\n",
      "for something to tell him they were almost there, but all the trees \n",
      "looked the same.\n",
      "And then they swung a little to the left and Thomas could see the \n",
      "moon again. The jungle thinned out to nothing and Thomas stopped, \n",
      "nearly jerking the handles away from Oscar. “The light,” he hissed. They \n",
      "had to put the stretcher down so Oscar could shut off the flashlight and \n",
      "put it back in his belt.\n",
      "There was the helicopter, just ahead. Thomas flexed his hands. They \n",
      "felt like they were full of knives.\n",
      "“I’m going to check it out,” Oscar said.\n",
      "“Okay.” Thomas didn’t offer the M16 and Oscar didn’t ask for it. \n",
      "Thomas crouched by the stretcher and listened to Oscar’s footsteps crash-\n",

      "want to know. It wouldn’t make any difference at this point anyway.\n",
      "Something metal squeaked and groaned. Thomas waited for the \n",
      "sound of gunfire. Instead he heard Oscar running back. Oscar took his \n",
      "end of the stretcher and didn’t say anything.\n",
      "Thomas put the gun next to Porter and they carried him into the \n",
      "clearing. The cargo door was open. Oscar rested his handles on the edge \n",
      "of the door and climbed in. Together they wrestled Porter onto the \n",
      "cabin floor. Thomas got in and shut the door and picked up the M16 \n",
      "again. He wanted a drink about as badly as he’d ever wanted anything. \n",
      "Maybe the Lacandones had something. Soon, he told himself. Soon.\n",
      "“You give him all the morphine?” Oscar said.\n",
      "“Half,” Thomas said. “The rest’s in his shirt.”\n",
      "Oscar turned the flashlight on and held it by the end with the bulb. \n",
      "His fingers glowed red in the light. He fished the needle out with his \n",

      "“Doctor?” Porter said.\n",
      "“Not yet. We’ll get you one. But we got this needle here, make you \n",

      "move his head. “Good,” Oscar said. “Now. Who are you with?”\n",
      "“...salis,” Porter said.\n",
      "“Marsalis?” Thomas asked.\n",
      "“Yeah.”\n",
      "162 lewis shiner\n",
      "One of Porter’s eyes was twitching. Thomas realized he had no heart \n",
      "for this.\n",
      "“Talk to me,” Oscar said.\n",
      "“For Christ’s sake,” Thomas said.\n",
      "“Wait outside if you want,” Oscar said. “Fuck, go back to camp if you \n",
      "want. We brought him this far, I want to hear the fucker talk.”\n",
      "Thomas stayed where he was.\n",
      "“Scared,” Porter said.\n",
      "“What?” Oscar said.\n",
      "“I’m scared,” Porter said. “I’m gonna die. Aren’t I?”\n",
      "“Oh, man,” Thomas said. “This is not right.”\n",
      "“This was your idea,” Oscar told him. “Live with it.” He looked back \n",
      "at Porter. “You’re gonna be fine. Let’s talk about Marsalis.”\n",
      "“What...you know about Marsalis?” Porter mumbled.\n",
      "“We’re supposed to hook up with him. Resupply. You’re in a Huey, \n",
      "okay?” Oscar showed the light around the walls a little. “But we can’t \n",
      "find where he’s bivouacked at.”\n",
      "“South,” Porter said. There was a gargling noise down in his chest. \n",
      "“South of Usumacinta. ‘Bout twenty miles.”\n",
      "Usumacinta was forty miles north and west of Na Chan. “Too god-\n",
      "damn close,” Oscar said.\n",
      "“Commies in some ruins,” Porter said. His lucid moment was over. \n",
      "“Blow them to shit.”\n",
      "That was it. It put Thomas over the top. It was like seeing Death in \n",
      "front of him with a scythe and an hourglass and a shit-eating grin. The \n",
      "brain chemicals he’d been churning out all day turned to adrenaline. He \n",

      "“What are you doing?”\n",
      "“I’m running away!” Thomas said. “Are you coming or not?”\n",
      "“What about this guy?”\n",
      "“Fuck him,” Thomas said. He sprung the door and jumped out into \n",
      "the night. He was on the other side of the helicopter from the rebels \n",
      "and there was at least a chance they hadn’t seen him. He sprinted for \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 163\n",
      "the jungle. The guns started to pop behind him before he quite made \n",
      "it. The leaves next to him danced in a wind he couldn’t feel. Bullets, he \n",
      "thought. It’s bullets making them do that.\n",
      "He held the M16 to his chest with both hands and dove into the \n",
      "underbrush. His glasses came halfway off and he pushed them frantically \n",
      "back up on his nose. When he looked back he counted four guns flash-\n",
      "ing yellow in the darkness. He pointed the M16 over their heads and \n",
      "pulled the trigger. It didn’t move. Safety, he thought. Most of his brain \n",
      "had shut down with the first shots. He found a switch just above his \n",
      "thumb and pushed it one way and then the other until he felt it click \n",
      "twice. This time the gun made a high-pitched rattle and bucked and \n",
      "pulled up and to the right. The muzzle flash lit up the trees around him.\n",
      "He rolled a little more and then got up and ran to his left, deeper \n",
      "into the trees. Somewhere in there he’d banged his left knee and it hurt \n",
      "something fierce. Yes, shit, they were coming after him. At least he gave \n",
      "Oscar a chance to get out of there. The asshole, why didn’t he run?\n",
      "He gave them another short burst. He remembered reading some-\n",
      "where that the muzzle would overheat if he fired it too long. He didn’t \n",
      "know how long that was. He didn’t even know, for Christ’s sake, how \n",
      "many rounds were left in the clip.\n",
      "He dodged right again. You can’t keep this up, he thought. His feet \n",
      "did a little dance of nerves without his conscious control. Do some-\n",
      "thing. Come on, come on.\n",
      "He thought of Lindsey again, Eddie putting it to her there in the dirt. \n",
      "He thought about Ramos saying how does this make you feel? Porter \n",
      "saying blow them to shit.\n",
      "He turned his back on the camp and ran due north into the jungle.\n",

      "had been cut back from the road so many times they had grown in \n",
      "on themselves in a kind of vegetable despair, gnarled and thick and low.\n",
      "Carmichael was an hour south of Usumacinta in a rented Volkswagen \n",
      "Safari. There was a hand-drawn map on the seat next to him. The road was \n",
      "paved, more or less, but he hadn’t seen another car since he’d left town.\n",
      "164 lewis shiner\n",
      "It was not helping his nerves.\n",
      "For the last week he’d been trying to put together a story on Marsalis \n",
      "without actually having to confront him. He interviewed everybody in \n",
      "Usumacinta who’d done business with Marsalis’s men, at the market and \n",
      "the garage and the liquor store. He talked to the two semipro hook-\n",
      "ers who worked at the laundry by day, politely declining their offers, \n",
      "though it had been a long time for him.\n",
      "He put together his map with an X where he was pretty sure they’d \n",
      "set up camp. He had an estimate of troop strength and the idea they \n",
      "were going to be here for a while. And he confirmed what he already \n",
      "suspected about their mission. They were after Carla.\n",
      "He called la every day for more background on Marsalis. He found \n",
      "out Marsalis was a member of something called the Church Universal \n",
      "and Triumphant, out of Malibu, as well as the Council for World \n",
      "Freedom and the World Anti-Communist League. He was divorced, \n",
      "with two kids in Montessori schools. There wasn’t much else to tell.\n",
      "Then, in the last two days, the Iran arms deal had broken and Pam \n",
      "had been keeping him current. Now there, Carmichael had to admit, \n",
      "was a hell of a story. What really got to him was that it looked like the \n",
      "US had turned a big profit on it and nobody knew where the money \n",
      "had gone. It was a sign of the times that after everything Reagan had \n",
      "done—from making war on Granada to escalating the arms race to \n",
      "supporting terrorism in Nicaragua—it was a bungled business deal that \n",
      "finally turned the public against him. And even then it might not have \n",
      "happened if the economy had been doing better.\n",
      "Whatever the reason, Carmichael knew he was not going to blow \n",
      "Iran off the front page with a lot of secondhand crap. At two o’clock \n",
      "that morning he’d realized he was putting off what he had to do be-\n",
      "cause he was afraid. Once he looked at it that way, he didn’t really have \n",
      "a choice.\n",
      "Up ahead he saw a discoloration on the asphalt and took his foot off \n",
      "the gas. He coasted up to the tracks and recognized the jeep treads he’d \n",
      "seen in town. They came from a dirt road that led off toward the west. \n",
      "He checked his map and everything about it looked right.\n",
      "The highway went on perfectly straight and flat for miles in either \n",
      "direction. The jungle grew within three feet of the tarmac. He was not \n",
      "going to be able to hide the car.\n",
      "His muscles cramped with the same fear he’d felt when he hid in the \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 165\n",
      "closet in Usumacinta, waiting to get bayoneted or worse. He drove a \n",
      "few yards past the turnoff and left the car with two wheels on the road. \n",
      "He opened up the engine and yanked loose one end of the cable that \n",
      "went from the distributor to the rotor. Car trouble, see? Everything that \n",
      "could connect him to Rolling Stone was back in his hotel room.\n",
      "His mouth was very dry. He took the canteen and the camera and just \n",
      "one extra roll of film. A real tourist wouldn’t be carrying more than that.\n",
      "He stopped for a second where the dirt road met the highway. The \n",
      "sun burned down on him from an empty sky. He could smell the dust \n",
      "and the bitter leaves of the roadside bushes. The insects sounded like \n",
      "tiny electric motors.\n",
      "He started walking.\n",
      "He kept close to the side of the road. With a little warning he could \n",
      "shove his way into the underbrush, though it would cost him some \n",
      "blood. He wished he’d worn long pants instead of hiking shorts.\n",
      "Sooner or later, he told himself, there would have to be some kind of \n",
      "trail leading away from the road. After nearly a mile, he found one. He \n",
      "crouched and looked at the boot prints in the soft ground. The grooves \n",
      "in the sole were clear enough that they might mean something to an \n",
      "expert. He went ahead and took a picture because he didn’t know how \n",
      "much else he would be able to get.\n",
      "When he looked up there was a gun barrel pointed at his face.\n",
      "“Jesus,” he said. “You scared me. I’m really glad to see you guys. \n",
      "You’re Amer—”\n",
      "“Shut up.”\n",
      "There were three of them. The one holding the gun had dirty blond \n",
      "hair to his shoulders, tied back with a headband. He had a couple of \n",
      "days’ worth of reddish-yellow beard, an olive-drab T-shirt, and blue jeans \n",
      "that had faded almost to white. One of the knees had been patched \n",
      "with a piece of bandana. He might have been the one that had spotted \n",
      "Carmichael in Usumacinta the week before.\n",
      "The second man looked to be in his forties, Caucasian, brown hair, \n",
      "khaki work clothes. The third was black and in his twenties, in camo \n",
      "pants and a hunter’s bright orange vest. Two of them had bullpups, the \n",
      "streamlined infantry rifles he’d seen in town, and the older white guy \n",
      "had an M16.\n",
      "“Lessee that camera,” the blond said.\n",
      "166 lewis shiner\n",
      "Carmichael handed it over. His legs were starting to hurt from the \n",
      "cramped squatting position. It was all he could do to keep them from \n",
      "shaking. “I didn’t mean anything,” he said. “My car—”\n",
      "“I said shut up.” The blond dropped the camera in the dirt and \n",
      "pushed the lens through the body with his heel. It made a sound like \n",
      "a beer can full of broken glass. Then he said, “Okay, stand up. Gene, pat \n",
      "him down.”\n",
      "The older white guy slapped at Carmichael’s pockets, not bother-\n",
      "ing to be gentle or very thorough. He found the film can and handed \n",
      "it to the blond, who said, “Watch him.” Gene brought his M16 up level \n",
      "and the blond tucked his bullpup under his arm. He pulled the unex-\n",
      "posed film out of the canister in a long, silvery ribbon. “Nope,” he said, \n",
      "holding it up to the sun. “Nothing on here.” They all laughed. “Always \n",
      "wanted to do that,” he said. “Where’s this car of yours?”\n",
      "“Back on the highway.”\n",
      "The blond dropped the film in the dirt and Gene handed him Car-\n",
      "michael’s wallet and pocket notebook. He looked through the blank \n",
      "notebook first and gave it back. Then he opened the wallet and looked \n",
      "at Carmichael’s driver’s license. “John Carmichael. Mind if I call you \n",
      "John? You got any dope in that car, John?”\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "“Got any pot, Johnny? You know, grass? Smoke?” He pantomimed \n",
      "inhaling off a roach, making a loud sucking noise.\n",
      "“Sorry,” Carmichael said. His dope was back in the hotel too.\n",
      "“I bet.” He handed Carmichael the wallet. “Let’s go.”\n",
      "They had to walk single file on the narrow trail. The black man went \n",
      "first, then Carmichael and the blond. Gene lagged well behind. The \n",
      "trees never got more than six or eight feet high, leaving Carmichael in \n",
      "blinding sunlight. The trail was clear enough, though, and he eventually \n",
      "got into his cross-country rhythm. If they were going to shoot him it \n",
      "wasn’t going to be right away.\n",
      "The trail ended in a base camp that was obviously still in progress. \n",
      "There were piles of burning brush around the edges of the clearing, \n",
      "and soot-stained men still working with machetes and chainsaws. In \n",
      "the largest open area were four military-green helicopters. As far as \n",
      "Carmichael could tell they were the same kind of Hueys the US had \n",
      "used in Vietnam.\n",
      "The rest of the camp was made up of long gi barracks tents, with \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 167\n",
      "tatami on the floor and the side flaps rolled all the way up to the roof. \n",
      "Inside were folding tables and chairs and cots. There were five tents, \n",
      "with about twenty men in each, reading or cleaning weapons or drink-\n",
      "ing coffee. That came out to about twice the number Carmichael had \n",
      "estimated. Some of them must have come in on the helicopters. They all \n",
      "stared as he went by, and some of them whistled and cheered.\n",
      "At the far end of the clearing was a four-man tent, side walls in place \n",
      "but the front flap open. The floor was plywood and Carmichael could \n",
      "see a wooden table and armchair inside.\n",
      "The black man went in first. Carmichael heard low voices for a while, \n",
      "then the man came out again. “Colonel says bring him in.”\n",
      "The blond motioned to Carmichael with his rifle barrel and followed \n",
      "him into the tent. Over his shoulder Carmichael watched the other two \n",
      "wander away.\n",
      "The inside of the tent was compulsively neat. There was a map \n",
      "cabinet with long, flat drawers and a Mr. Coffee on an upended wooden \n",
      "crate. On the back wall were three framed prints, evenly spaced, at \n",
      "Carmichael’s eye level. They were each about the size of a hardcover \n",
      "book and done in the gaudy, luminescent style that Carmichael \n",
      "associated with Indian religious paintings, like in the Bhagavad Gita. The \n",
      "face on the left was the traditional Jesus: light suntan, curly hair, doe \n",
      "eyes, and a full beard. Carmichael didn’t recognize the face on the right. \n",
      "A European with swept-back hair and a pointy mustache.\n",
      "The picture in the middle was some kind of allegory. The top half \n",
      "was a series of brightly colored concentric circles, with white rays \n",
      "coming out of the middle. The bottom was a landscape, with a figure \n",
      "in white robes apparently consumed by purple flames, then rising \n",
      "up in a cylinder of white light. Scary shit to see in a military office, \n",
      "Carmichael thought.\n",
      "Marsalis himself sat up straight in his chair, both arms comfortably on \n",
      "the desk in front of him. His skin was deep black and he had a small, \n",
      "neatly trimmed mustache. His hair had been straightened and was cut \n",
      "short and parted on the side. He wore neatly pressed khakis without \n",
      "insignia, but the cap on the hat rack had two eagles on it. The desk was \n",
      "empty except for a stack of greenbar computer printouts in one corner \n",
      "and a complex emerald crystal that was holding them down.\n",
      "“Carmichael,” Marsalis said. “What a pleasant coincidence. I’ve been \n",
      "hoping to meet you ever since I heard you were down in our neck of \n",
      "168 lewis shiner\n",
      "the woods. I enjoyed your story on Count Basie last year, by the way. \n",
      "Though I’m afraid I have trouble with your more political pieces.”\n",
      "Uh oh, Carmichael thought. “My car broke down,” he said. “On the \n",
      "highway.”\n",
      "“In fact,” Marsalis went on, “word has it you just scored quite a coup. \n",
      "An interview with Carla herself.”\n",
      "“Where did you hear that?” Carmichael said.\n",
      "“Oh come on, John, don’t be naive. Now I know it’s too much to \n",
      "expect you to actually have the tapes on you. But if you’ll tell me where \n",
      "they are, I can send somebody after them.”\n",
      "Pretending ignorance seemed like a waste of time. “The story’s fin-\n",
      "ished and turned in. I already reused the tape. Sorry.”\n",
      "“Really?” Marsalis said. “That seems odd. I’d think you would have \n",
      "wanted it maybe for a souvenir.” Carmichael shrugged. “Well, that’s a \n",
      "problem. It’s going to make things a lot more difficult.”\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "“Well, if you haven’t got the tapes, we’ll have to just get you to re-\n",
      "construct the interview from memory.”\n",
      "“Um, my memory was never that good.”\n",
      "Marsalis smiled. “You might be surprised. It’s amazing what people \n",
      "can remember.”\n",
      "“What are you going to do,” Carmichael asked. “Torture me?” The \n",
      "words came out a little too high-pitched for bravado.\n",
      "“Billy?” Marsalis said to the blond. “Put John somewhere you can \n",
      "keep an eye on him for a few hours. Let him think things out.”\n",
      "“My editor knows where I am,” Carmichael said. “They know you’re \n",
      "here. If anything happens to me, they’ll know where to look.”\n",
      "“That pretty much shoots your car trouble story, doesn’t it, John? Not \n",
      "that anybody was really buying it anyway. As for Rolling Stone, you’ll \n",
      "forgive me if I’m not exactly shaking in my shoes. Billy?”\n",
      "“Let’s go,” Billy said.\n",
      "If anything, Carmichael thought, it would be drugs. Torture just \n",
      "had to be messy and unreliable. Not an eighties kind of thing to do \n",
      "to somebody.\n",
      "He sat on a cot in a two-man tent. Billy was under a tree outside \n",
      "with El Libro Sentimental, a digest-sized Mexican love comic printed \n",
      "in foul smelling brown ink. It was two o’clock, almost time for the \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 169\n",
      "afternoon rain. The sky had started to cloud over and there was enough \n",
      "wind to gently rattle the sides of the tent.\n",
      "Billy looked at the clouds and put the comic aside. He leaned \n",
      "his bullpup against the tree and stood up. “Om,” he said, putting \n",
      "his palms together at his forehead, drawing out the word until it \n",
      "hummed.\n",
      "What the hell? Carmichael thought.\n",
      "“Ma, Hum,” Billy said, moving his steepled hands to his throat and \n",
      "the center of his chest. He sounded a little like the insects in the trees. \n",
      "“Vazra,” he said, and made a quick downward gesture with his fingers, \n",
      "like a piano player hitting a chord. It was a strangely delicate gesture for \n",
      "somebody that meaty, sunburned, and tough-looking. “Guru,” he said, \n",
      "turning his palms up, “Padme,” a figure eight with index fingers touch-\n",
      "ing thumbs against his stomach, “Sidhe,” like two OK signs, palms out, \n",
      "“Hum,” bringing the heels of his hands together.\n",
      "He went through the whole thing again, over and over, until the rain \n",
      "started. Then he brought the gun and the comic into the tent.\n",
      "“What was that about?” Carmichael asked him.\n",
      "“The mudras, you mean?” Billy said. “Sealing my light. There’s that \n",
      "kind of vibe you get right before the storm moves in, you know? Gives \n",
      "me the willies.”\n",
      "He seemed friendly enough when there wasn’t anybody else around \n",
      "to impress. “Is it okay if I talk to you?” Carmichael said. “I mean, it \n",
      "wouldn’t get you in trouble.”\n",
      "“Fuck no,” Billy said. “Colonel would probably like it. We going to \n",
      "talk about Carla?”\n",
      "“No,” Carmichael said. “Not Carla.”\n",
      "“Whatever. You’ll be talking about her later, anyway.” Billy laughed \n",
      "and Carmichael felt his stomach tense.\n",
      "“What’s the story with you guys, anyway? What are those pictures \n",
      "Marsalis has up in his tent? The first one is Jesus, right, but who’s the \n",
      "other guy?”\n",
      "“St. Germain.”\n",
      "“You mean...wait a minute. Are you talking about that guy that \n",
      "Dracula is supposed to be based on?”\n",
      "“Yeah, but that was a lot of superstitious shit. St. Germain is one of \n",
      "the ascended masters.”\n",
      "“Ascended masters.”\n",
      "170 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Yeah, the Great White Brotherhood. You know? I mean, not ‘white’ \n",
      "like some fascist shit, ‘white’ as in ‘white light.’”\n",
      "Carmichael sat for a second, letting it sink in. “You guys are all \n",
      "into this?”\n",
      "“More or less. When the Colonel talks it all makes a lot of sense. I \n",
      "mean, it’s all just about tapping your potential, is what it comes down to. \n",
      "The mystical shit, it’s just like a crutch or something.”\n",
      "“Does this have anything to do with that church? What was it, the \n",
      "Church Universal and Triumphant or something?”\n",
      "“Yeah, Marsalis used to be with them. They kicked him out. Didn’t \n",
      "like his politics. But he says you don’t need to be part of a church. You \n",
      "can do it for yourself.”\n",
      "“How’d you get into it?”\n",
      "Billy leaned back and put his arms behind his head. “Most of us was \n",
      "in the Nam together. It was a pretty heavy scene, but it was cool in \n",
      "some ways, too. I mean, once you got away from the fact we were let-\n",
      "ting the gooks beat the shit out of us and people were getting killed \n",
      "and everything. But that’s just karma, you know? Being over there really \n",
      "changed a lot of people’s heads. People were turning on, getting away \n",
      "from material shit, trying to change themselves, thinking about what \n",
      "the point of it all was, you know? Not just in the Nam, but back in the \n",
      "world, too. And then it got to be the seventies, and it looked like every-\n",
      "body got tired of it.”\n",
      "“Most people, yeah,” Carmichael said. “Everybody wanted a bmw \n",
      "and a vcr.”\n",
      "“Yeah, really. All those initials, man, got to have ‘em. But what the \n",
      "Colonel says is, it’s not over. It’s just gone underground. People realized \n",
      "they couldn’t change the world, so they started trying to change them-\n",
      "selves. Like, did you see that rock on the Colonel’s desk?”\n",
      "“Yeah. It looked like some kind of emerald.”\n",
      "“It’s made of a bunch of crummy emeralds dissolved in acid, and then \n",
      "like recrystallized into one big matrix. Transformed, see? Keeping the \n",
      "essence and making it into something better. I mean, look at you guys \n",
      "at the Stone. You’re real slick these days, but you still got principles and \n",
      "shit. Hey, man, I admire that. I mean, there’s all these networks now of \n",
      "guys that think the way we do.”\n",
      "Carmichael wasn’t sure he wanted to be part of that “we.” “You guys \n",
      "are a network?” he asked.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 171\n",
      "“Yeah. Yeah, we are. See, what the Colonel says is, America has got a \n",
      "special destiny. The Brotherhood, the ascended masters, they’re watching \n",
      "over us, and our job is to bring on the Aquarian Age. And that’s what \n",
      "it’s really all about down here. Communism, let’s face it, man, is a very \n",
      "unhip, unenlightened way to live. We got to keep America free or we’re \n",

      "“The boat?”\n",

      "or you go back to the trenches for another two thousand years.”\n",
      "“You’re talking literal transcendence?” Carmichael asked. Billy nar-\n",

      "had another insight. It was the drug making him feel this way. But he \n",

      "first time there had actually been gunfire at night, and there was a lot of \n",
      "it. She put Spanish Made Simple face down on the silver floor of the tent \n",
      "and went outside.\n",
      "It was coming from over by the helicopter. A half dozen campfires \n",

      "gotten infected, that Carla was on the edge of delirium. Her eyes were \n",

      "It took another ten minutes for her to get the story out of them. \n",
      "Thomas was gone, had disappeared into the jungle with an automatic \n",

      "Lindsey couldn’t believe it. Thomas would never do something like \n",

      "sometime after midnight, then woke up to the sound of a baby crying.\n",
      "The sound wrenched at her heart. She got up and followed it to a \n",

      "a place like this, constantly on the run, never knowing when she could \n",
      "be hurt, or killed, or left without anybody to take care of her?\n",
      "But then, Lindsey thought, she was hardly in a position to talk about \n",

      "without any kind of protection. And right in the middle of her cycle, \n",
      "too. She’d been off the pill since February. It wasn’t like her to take \n",

      "And then Ramos stepped in front of him and shot him in the head.\n",
      "It was close range, maybe eight or ten feet. Ramos had one of \n",
      "those military .45 automatics, dark and square and efficient-looking. \n",
      "The bullet took Gordo on the left side of his nose, just under the eye. It \n",
      "went clear through his head. When it came out the back it took a hand-\n",
      "ful of red and yellow meat with it. Gordo spun around and fell on his \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 185\n",
      "face. As he went down his rifle fired a burst into the dirt, inches away \n",
      "from Ramos’ feet. Ramos didn’t even flinch.\n",
      "Lindsey felt her stomach drop, like it had fallen right out of her body. \n",
      "She thought it meant she was going to be sick but nothing else hap-\n",
      "pened. She just felt cold and empty inside.\n",
      "It was quiet except for the insects. A couple of flies had found the \n",
      "hole in the back of Gordo’s head and were crawling around the edges \n",
      "of it. Ramos put his pistol back in its holster and slowly everyone got \n",
      "up again, slapping the dust off their pants. Somebody laughed, a little \n",
      "hysterically. It didn’t catch on.\n",
      "“OK, “ Faustino said. “¡Andemos!” People started to shuffle their feet.\n",

      "Lindsey could see it perfectly from where she sat, 15 feet up on one of \n",

      "Ramos himself stood on the lowest landing of the steps, level with \n",
      "Lindsey but farther forward. He had a classic stance, legs spread wide, fist \n",
      "either in the air or pounding against his left hand. Carla’s entire army, \n",
      "numbering maybe eighty men, women, and children, sat at his feet.\n",
      "Lindsey’s legs dangled over the ledge. She kicked them up and down, \n",
      "impatient with the seriousness of it all. Oscar sat on her right, Chan \n",

      "“So what’s he saying?” she asked Oscar.\n",
      "“He says Carla’s fucking up. He says they have to get out of the \n",

      "“What isn’t working?”\n",
      "“Tercerismo. That’s prime revolutionary jargon, man. The old way is \n",

      "“So if Ramos takes over . . . and this fp whatever—”\n",

      "The US had their chance with Nicaragua, and those guys were more \n",
      "Marxist than Carla. The Sandinistas asked the US for help and the US \n",
      "told them to fuck themselves. So the next day they asked the Russians. \n",
      "That was when the hammer and sickle went up on the flagpole. What \n",
      "else were they going to do? But Carla would play ball with the US if \n",

      "He looked over to his right, where Carla was sitting. Lindsey looked \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 187\n",
      "too. Carla’s eyes were glazed over and her back slumped. Oscar shook \n",
      "his head. “The old Carla would have. I don’t know if she’s got the stuff \n",
      "anymore.”\n",
      "“I thought you didn’t like her,” Lindsey said.\n",

      "some asshole like Ramos or Venceremos.”\n",
      "Ramos got to the end of a thought and there was some applause, a \n",

      "“Compañeros,” she said.\n",

      "a whisper. “Each of us must find our own revolution inside ourselves. \n",
      "Our country must lose what each of us as people must lose. The lust for \n",

      "He decided to look for her by the river. If he took it easy and \n",
      "stopped to rest he could make it that far. The rebel who was supposed \n",
      "to be guarding him had gone to sleep. Eddie decided not to bother with \n",
      "shoes and walked off in his T-shirt and cutoffs and bare feet.\n",
      "He saw an iguana on the far end of the Palace steps and stalked it for \n",
      "a while. It was a real beauty, three feet if you counted the tail, and the \n",

      "on its back that wobbled when it moved. Whenever it turned its head \n",

      "He’d gotten within six feet when there was a gunshot and the \n",

      "left. He moved in that direction, staying in the shadow of the Palace’s \n",
      "north wall.\n",
      "Ramos was there, and Faustino, and Carla leaning on her crutch. \n",
      "They were lined up with four other soldiers in khaki and jeans. Directly \n",
      "in front of them was a man on his knees and another man lying on his \n",
      "stomach in the dirt. Facing them across the clearing were another dozen \n",
      "soldiers, poor paisanos with ragged clothes and rope belts and cheap \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 191\n",
      "canvas shoes. Only a couple of them had the shiny new assault rifles like \n",
      "the officers did. The rest had shotguns and .22s.\n",
      "Somebody had been working here, too. The worst of the weeds and \n",
      "brush had been cleared out between the collapsed stone grandstands. At \n",
      "the edge of the ball court they’d made a hole. It was the size and shape \n",
      "of a shallow grave.\n",
      "Ramos stood in front of the kneeling man, a .45 automatic in one \n",
      "hand and a red plastic notebook in the other. “—of this tribunal,” he \n",
      "read out of the book, “that you are guilty of the crime of desertion, for \n",
      "which the sentence is death. Do you have anything to say?”\n",
      "The kneeling man’s hands were pressed against his crotch. His arms \n",
      "shook and they made the front of his shirt vibrate with them. Ramos put \n",
      "the gun against the man’s head. He paused for an agonizing second and \n",
      "then he fired, jerking the gun back as he pulled the trigger, like it was a \n",
      "toy pistol. The sound got to Eddie a fraction of a second after the image, \n",
      "out of synch, and echoed off the stone wall of the Palace. Blood dribbled \n",
      "off the dead man’s face and for a horrible moment it looked like he \n",
      "was going to stand up, but it was just some kind of muscle spasm that \n",
      "straightened his back and sent him falling over into the fresh-cut weeds.\n",
      "Ramos put his gun away in a holster with a flap on it and buttoned \n",
      "the flap. “Tell everyone what you have seen today,” he said to his ragged \n",
      "audience. “You and you, put the bodies in the ground.” Two men came \n",
      "forward and clumsily stretched the first corpse on its back. The one at \n",
      "the end where the head was wouldn’t touch the dead man’s skin. He \n",
      "grabbed a handful of shirt and carried him that way.\n",
      "Eddie turned away. He would have to cross the ball court if he wanted \n",
      "to go to the river and it wasn’t worth it. He wondered if Ramos was con-\n",

      "Eddie knew this was bad news, though he wasn’t sure how bad or what \n",
      "it meant specifically.\n",
      "He walked slowly back the way he came. His eyes and lungs burned \n",
      "and he could hear his pulse beating in his ears. He thought about going \n",
      "back to sleep but his muscles were wound up tight. Maybe just from the \n",
      "fear of sleeping and not being able to wake up again.\n",
      "192 lewis shiner\n",
      "Instead of going back to the tent he circled around through the \n",
      "scrawny trees at the north end of the clearing. He felt physically and \n",
      "mentally down, the way he would coming off a long acid trip.\n",
      "If you take the mushrooms again, he told himself, you will die.\n",
      "He heard digging up ahead. He found Chan Ma’ax and half the \n",
      "Lacandones working in a trench. Ma’ax Garcia was there, and Nuxi’, \n",
      "with a palm leaf tied around his head. They were all stripped down to \n",
      "their loincloths. Eddie was relieved to see them. The trench was over \n",
      "ten feet long, growing at both ends. Chan Ma’ax stood in the middle, \n",
      "leaning on an army entrenching tool.\n",
      "“Tal in wilech,” he said to Chan Ma’ax,\n",
      "“Everybody look,” the old man said in Mayan. He had his wrist \n",
      "cocked at an angle that made him look like a clown, or a crazy man. \n",
      "“Kukulcán comes back from the east, just like they always said.”\n",
      "“Kukulcán?” Eddie said.\n",
      "“Careful,” Chan Ma’ax said. “They put you to work too.”\n",
      "There were two soldiers looking on. They sat with their backs against \n",
      "trees, smoking, and they didn’t seem interested in Eddie at all. He was \n",
      "apparently not covered by their orders. Eddie squatted Mayan-style at \n",
      "the edge of the trench. “What was that Kukulcán business about?”\n",
      "“You know,” Chan Ma’ax said. “The Aztecs, they call him \n",
      "Quetzalcoatl. The snake with feathers. A white man who comes out \n",
      "of the west to save us. But he gets drunk and screws his sister and has \n",
      "to leave in disgrace. He sails off to the east, saying he will come back \n",
      "someday. And here you are.”\n",
      "“I can’t even save myself,” Eddie said. “What are you doing here?”\n",
      "“Digging holes,” Chan Ma’ax said. “So the soldiers can hide when \n",

      "“Have you seen Lindsey? Or Thomas?”\n",
      "The old man shook his head. “Probably working somewhere. Every-\n",

      "“I thought it was another twenty-five years.” Eddie was trying to kid \n",
      "him around but it wasn’t working.\n",
      "Chan Ma’ax licked his thumb and rubbed a cut on the knuckle of his \n",
      "left hand. “Even the end has to start somewhere.”\n",
      "“Andale,” said one of the guards. Chan Ma’ax looked at Eddie for \n",
      "another long second and then bent over and started shoveling dirt out \n",
      "of the hole.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 193\n",
      "What was the point, Eddie wondered, in being t’o’ohil if you still had \n",

      "fuls of leaves as he walked back toward the clearing, crushing them up \n",
      "until his fingers hurt.\n",
      "Everything was coming apart. Including his body. He was so weak. \n",
      "He sat down in the path. A sharp rock dug into his hip. The pain was \n",
      "comfortable, reassuring, told him he was still alive. He lay down on his \n",
      "stomach, pressing himself into the rocks and dirt and decaying leaves. \n",
      "He could hardly feel anything. He rubbed the palm of his left hand \n",
      "against a slab of limestone, back and forth, over and over, until he felt \n",
      "the stone turn slick with blood.\n",
      "He rolled onto his back. His feet were moving, like they were tap-\n",
      "ping out the beat to some inaudible song. He had to let them go or \n",
      "his leg muscles would cramp. The stubble on his face itched and his \n",
      "scalp hurt where he’d slept with his hair matted wrong. He wanted to \n",
      "eat meat, to get drunk, to fuck Lindsey. He touched the crotch of his \n",
      "cutoffs. His penis was soft. Malnutrition, probably, or just another side \n",
      "effect of the drug.\n",
      "He felt a long, slow scream building up in his lungs, but when he \n",
      "opened his mouth, nothing came out.\n",
      "He didn’t remember coming to the mushroom grove. Here he was \n",
      "anyway. He sat down in front of the plants. Really, he should at least say \n",
      "goodbye to Lindsey. She’d said she still loved him and all. But then he’d \n",
      "tried to find her and she wasn’t around. He didn’t have that much to say \n",
      "to her anyway. Just goodbye.\n",
      "He broke off a thumb-sized piece of mushroom and ate it. Then he \n",
      "ate another. His left hand had stopped bleeding. He slapped it gently \n",
      "against his leg, punctuating the rhythm of his jiggling feet. He ate one \n",
      "more little piece, just for luck.\n",
      "Okay, he thought. That should do it.\n",
      "He lay back on his elbows and waited, and a few minutes later the \n",
      "ground began to move under him.\n",
      "He lay in a hammock strung between the walls of a stone room. \n",
      "Most of the front wall was open to the sky. He could see clouds and \n",
      "sunlight and the tops of trees.\n",
      "He swung his legs over the edge of the hammock. He was dizzy for a \n",
      "194 lewis shiner\n",
      "second and then it passed. He put his feet in the sandals that were lying \n",
      "there and stood up.\n",
      "Across the three-sided room was a man in a jaguar skin and bright \n",
      "green quetzal feathers. His hair had been shaved in front and then tied \n",
      "in a topknot to show off his long, sloping forehead. He stared at Eddie \n",
      "with tired eyes. “You’re awake,” he said.\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "“You’ve been sleeping for three days. Your arms and legs moved, like \n",
      "an animal’s.”\n",
      "Eddie nodded. He remembered being carried here, but not much \n",
      "else. He walked carefully to the open wall of the temple and held onto \n",
      "the lintel overhead for balance.\n",
      "He was in a cluster of smaller temples east of the big pyramid. Two \n",
      "flights of steps led down to a paved avenue below him. His temple, and \n",
      "the one next to it, were built out of the side of a mountain. He could \n",
      "see the entire south end of the city. There were two temples across from \n",
      "him, set on low pyramids. Their steep roofs were carved and painted \n",
      "with historical scenes, and above them were the elaborate brickwork \n",
      "grids of their roof combs. In the middle distance he could see the ruler’s \n",
      "palace with its tower, and beyond it the great pyramid.\n",
      "To the west the trees started again, orchards of ramón and chicosa-\n",
      "pote. Between the trees were the family compounds, thatched wooden \n",
      "huts on dirt platforms, all facing a central square. The largest compounds \n",
      "belonged to the nobles, and they were the ones closest to the temples. \n",
      "Some of them had burned to the ground, the ashes still smoking. \n",
      "Thousands of peasant huts and milpas and orchards stretched out beyond \n",
      "them to the horizon.\n",
      "It was early afternoon and the harsh sunlight washed out the brilliant \n",
      "reds and yellows of the temples. If Eddie squinted his eyes they looked \n",
      "like they had no color at all. It reminded him of something but he \n",
      "couldn’t think what.\n",
      "The army was camped in the main square, between the ruler’s palace \n",
      "and the great pyramid. Most of them were sleeping. The worst of the \n",
      "wounded were being bandaged and fed. It all seemed strange and famil-\n",
      "iar at the same time. Eddie couldn’t say why the army was there, in the \n",
      "middle of the city with their weapons, but it seemed right that they were.\n",
      "“Do you remember anything?” the feathered man asked him. “Do \n",
      "you remember me?”\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 195\n",
      "“Chilam...” Eddie said, and then shook his head. “I don’t know.”\n",
      "“Chilam Sotz’,” the man said. “I am chief priest. Do you even know \n",
      "your own name?”\n",
      "“Eddie,” he said. “I think my name is Eddie.” It sounded wrong even \n",
      "as he said it.\n",
      "“That’s not a proper name,” Chilam Sotz’ said.\n",
      "Every time Eddie tried to concentrate he lost what he’d been think-\n",
      "ing. All he could remember was a little old man who looked like a \n",
      "monkey. “There is another name...Kukulcán. You could call me that.”\n",
      "“Do you know how you got here?”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Some soldiers found you walking in the city. You were dressed like \n",
      "a true person, but your skin was so pale they thought you were a ghost. \n",
      "So they brought you to me. I am to learn if you are a ghost or not.”\n",
      "“Have you decided?” Eddie asked.\n",
      "“Yes. You are not a ghost. If you were a ghost, you would not speak \n",
      "Mam so badly.”\n",
      "“Why are...why are the soldiers out there?”\n",
      "“Because of the war.”\n",
      "“What war?”\n",
      "“We are fighting with our own people.”\n",
      "Eddie felt dizzy again. “Your own people.”\n",
      "“I don’t know what to tell you about this,” Chilam Sotz’ said. “I don’t \n",
      "know what it is that you don’t know.”\n",
      "“Tell me everything. Tell me about the people you’re fighting against.”\n",
      "“They are young, mostly. Peasants. They say there are too many \n",
      "priests. That’s one thing. Too many nobles, too many temples. They say \n",
      "the world is out of balance. They say the gods have turned their backs \n",
      "to us. This is why the crops have been bad for so many years, why the \n",
      "animals are so hard to find.” Chilam Sotz’ leaned his head against the \n",
      "wall behind him. He was old, Eddie realized. Maybe twice Eddie’s age. \n",
      "Old and very tired.\n",
      "“They have a new religion,” Chilam Sotz’ went on. “They have these \n",
      "funny ideas about time. Everybody knows time goes in a circle, but they \n",
      "think time can’t take care of itself. They think we have to leave the cities \n",
      "and go back to the jungle, forget everything we know. So that when the \n",
      "cycle ends everything will be the way it was when it started. Men like \n",
      "animals, living in the dirt.”\n",
      "196 lewis shiner\n",
      "“I saw it,” Eddie said suddenly.\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "“The end of the cycle.” It surprised him as much as it did Chilam \n",
      "Sotz’. “What they say is true. The temples will be grown over with \n",
      "jungle. The people will live in huts by themselves. They won’t have any \n",
      "priests. They won’t remember the names of the gods. They won’t even \n",
      "remember the Long Count.”\n",
      "“So,” Chilam Sotz’ said.\n",
      "“I’m sorry. I make it sound like this city—all this beauty—like it’s all \n",
      "for nothing. But other people will remember you. People with skin the \n",
      "color of ghosts. Like mine, but even lighter.”\n",
      "“It doesn’t matter,” Chilam Sotz’ said. “There is no meaning in the \n",
      "great cycle. It exists, that’s all. You can’t worry too much about your \n",
      "place in it. You can go crazy if you do.” He got up and straightened his \n",
      "feathered headdress. “If you’re strong enough we should go see the ruler. \n",
      "He wanted me to tell him when you woke up.”\n",
      "“Why not?” Eddie said.\n",
      "The air in the plaza smelled of smoke and sweating soldiers and \n",
      "dust broiling in the sun. The soldiers wore loincloths and woven head-\n",
      "bands. The only weapons Eddie saw were spears, some of them with ob-\n",
      "sidian points, some just sharpened and hardened in fire. They all shifted \n",
      "away from Eddie when he walked by, afraid of his pale skin.\n",
      "The plaza was paved with limestone blocks. Eddie felt the heat \n",
      "coming up through his sandals. At the north end, well away from the \n",
      "soldiers, he saw a few merchants and traders still trying to do business. \n",
      "They had their mats laid out and covered with pots and feathers, ear-\n",
      "spools and rings and necklaces, seashells and occasional pieces of jade. \n",
      "Nobody was buying.\n",
      "The temples towered over all of them, defying the jungle, defy-\n",
      "ing time itself. High up on the Temple of the Inscriptions two lords \n",
      "consulted a priest. The lords wore fur boots and short capes and knee \n",
      "breeches of cloth painted with stylized glyphs. Their elaborate hats were \n",
      "made from the heads of deer. The animals seemed to be craning their \n",
      "necks to look up at something. The priest had jaguar boots like Chilam \n",
      "Sotz’, and a headdress with peacock feathers. They all wore ear-spools \n",
      "and necklaces of jade.\n",
      "There were low-relief sculptures everywhere, on the roofs of the \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 197\n",
      "temples, on the sides of the stairs, on stone tablets taller than Eddie, \n",
      "standing upright in the square. Eddie stopped in front of one of the \n",
      "tablets. The glyphs, like rows of fat, curled bugs, were painted in shades \n",
      "of red and brown. They surrounded the figure of a nobleman with red \n",
      "skin and green feathers and black and yellow furs.\n",
      "“This way,” Chilam Sotz’ said. He climbed the steps of the Palace. \n",
      "Two guards at the top of the steps nodded to him and stood aside to let \n",
      "him in. Eddie followed him across a narrow room with a high, vaulted \n",
      "ceiling and then into a grassy courtyard. The tower rose up out of the \n",
      "southwest corner. There were men up in the highest level, one in each \n",
      "of the four windows, staring out into the distance.\n",
      "They went up a short flight of steps and into another set of rooms. \n",
      "There was more stucco relief on the walls, pictures of past rulers. Eddie \n",
      "stopped to look at one of them. The man was in profile, as always, to \n",
      "show the long forehead that bulged smoothly into the hatchet nose. His \n",
      "headdress was full of seabirds and fish. His right hand held what looked \n",
      "like a sword, except it had branches coming off it like a tree.\n",
      "“Pacal,” Chilam Sotz’ said. “He made this into the greatest city in the \n",
      "empire. There hasn’t been a ruler like him since.” Eddie saw two more \n",
      "guards coming toward them. Chilam Sotz’ made a small noise in his \n",
      "throat. “Until now, of course.” The guards bowed to Chilam Sotz’ and \n",
      "looked at Eddie with suspicion.\n",
      "“Where is the ruler?” Chilam Sotz’ asked them.\n",
      "“The steambaths, lord.”\n",
      "Chilam Sotz’ nodded and took Eddie to the back of the Palace. Most \n",
      "of the rooms he passed were empty, or were full of material goods, \n",
      "pots and furs and rolls of dyed fabric. There didn’t seem to be any state \n",
      "business going on, no laws being written, no verdicts handed down, no \n",
      "ambassadors entertained.\n",
      "The door to the baths was closed with a woven mat. Inside there \n",
      "didn’t seem to be any air at all. The walls were glazed, like pottery. \n",
      "Naked male servants carried in dishes of glowing coals from the cook-\n",
      "ing hut. They dumped them into stone troughs and poured water over \n",
      "them, sending up clouds of steam and the stink of wet ashes. Sweat \n",
      "came out all over Eddie’s body.\n",
      "The ruler sat on a stone bench, naked except for jewelry and quetzal \n",
      "feathers braided in his hair. He was tall and his face was smooth and \n",
      "nicely proportioned. He would have been handsome except for his \n",
      "198 lewis shiner\n",
      "huge stomach and chest. His eyes were small and had a look of cheer-\n",
      "ful dissipation. A short, thick-waisted woman, also naked, stroked his \n",
      "chest, ears, and neck with another handful of feathers. Water had beaded \n",
      "up on her skin, on her small, squarish breasts, on the dark tangle of hair \n",
      "between her thighs. Another woman crouched between the ruler’s legs, \n",
      "his half-inflated penis in her mouth.\n",
      "Chilam Sotz’ dropped to his knees, crossed his arms over his chest, \n",
      "touched his head to the floor. Eddie awkwardly copied him. “The \n",
      "stranger, lord,” Chilam Sotz’ said, sitting back on his haunches. “He says \n",
      "his name is Kukulcán.”\n",
      "Eddie stayed bent over a little longer. The air was cooler close to the \n",
      "floor and it also made it easier for him to breathe if he didn’t look at the \n",
      "naked women. When he sat up he said, “Utz-in puksiqual.” My heart is \n",
      "good. Sweat ran off his hands as he held them out, palms up.\n",
      "The ruler nodded distractedly. Chilam Sotz’ said, “He has had a vision, \n",
      "while he slept. He has seen the great cities in ruins at the end of the cycle.”\n",
      "“What’s the matter with his skin?” the ruler said. “Is he a Mexícan?”\n",
      "“No, lord. The Mexícans have small noses and no foreheads.”\n",
      "“Maybe he’s sick.” The ruler picked up a bowl and slurped at it. Eddie \n",
      "could smell the chocolate and it made his stomach growl. “Are you \n",
      "sick?” the ruler asked him.\n",
      "“No, lord,” Eddie said.\n",
      "The ruler looked at Chilam Sotz’, “Well, then. He doesn’t seem very \n",
      "fearsome. What should we do with him?”\n",
      "“We should ask him more questions, lord. His vision may be very \n",
      "important. If it is a true dream—”\n",
      "“I don’t care about dreams,” the ruler said. “But you can do with him \n",
      "what you want.”\n",
      "“Lord, if it is true that the great cities will be empty at the end of the \n",
      "cycle, then maybe we should listen to—”\n",
      "“By the end of the cycle you and I will be dirt.” The ruler opened his \n",
      "eyes wide, as if he’d caught himself going to sleep. “Take your Mexícan \n",
      "and go away. Don’t talk to me anymore about the end of the cycle.”\n",
      "“Yes, lord.” Chilam Sotz’ bowed again and so did Eddie, and they \n",
      "backed out into the hallway.\n",
      "Chilam Sotz’ took Eddie to the cooking hut to eat. It was behind \n",
      "the Palace and on a low dirt platform, oblong and rounded at the ends, \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 199\n",
      "like peasant huts. Smoke leaked out between the wall slats and through \n",
      "the dried brown thatch of the roof.\n",
      "Eddie sat on a mat between the cookfires. There were three male \n",
      "cooks, and women and children grinding corn and cutting vegetables \n",
      "wherever there was room. All of them seemed agonizingly conscious of \n",
      "Chilam Sotz’ and Eddie. Every couple of minutes a servant ran out with \n",
      "a dish of coals for the steambath.\n",
      "“Do you want meat?” Chilam Sotz’ asked. Eddie shook his head. \n",
      "“Good. There isn’t much meat these days.” He gave Eddie beans and \n",
      "tortillas and strips of fried squash and a lumpy bowl of manioc.\n",
      "He watched Eddie eat for a while and then he asked, “What did you \n",
      "think of the ruler?”\n",
      "Eddie stared at him. The question didn’t make sense. Rulers were like \n",
      "the great cycle. They weren’t something to have an opinion about. “It \n",
      "looked like he wasn’t really listening to you,” he said finally.\n",
      "“No,” Chilam Sotz’ said, “he wasn’t. He’s afraid of hearing that he \n",
      "could be wrong. He’s afraid of a lot of things. More every day. He was \n",
      "brought up to eat well and father little rulers and remember all the \n",
      "religious days. He doesn’t know how to deal with trouble like we have \n",
      "now. There wasn’t anybody to teach him about it.”\n",
      "Eddie looked around. Everyone was pretending not to have heard the \n",
      "blasphemy. “I don’t understand why he wanted to talk to me,” Eddie \n",
      "said. “If he’s afraid of what I had to say.”\n",
      "“He wanted to see if you were dangerous,” Chilam Sotz’ said. “If he \n",
      "thought you were, he would have had you killed.”\n",
      "“Oh,” Eddie said.\n",
      "“It’s the only thing he really knows how to do. He has a wall of \n",
      "priests and nobles between him and the real world. If something gets \n",
      "through that wall and scares him, he has it killed.”\n",
      "“You think the ruler is wrong,” Eddie said quietly. “You agree with \n",
      "the others. The ones that want to leave the city.”\n",
      "“I am chief priest. The chief priest owes his life to the ruler.”\n",
      "“Whatever you say. These people. The ‘others’ you were talking about. \n",
      "Do they have a name for this new religion?”\n",
      "“They don’t call it a religion. They call themselves a clan.”\n",
      "“A clan?” Eddie said. The word made him uneasy.\n",
      "“Yes. They call themselves after the Raccoon. The Haawo’.”\n",
      "•\n",
      "200 lewis shiner\n",
      "Eddie had been awake for a long time now. Long enough to watch \n",
      "the last of the light fade and feel the heat of the day start to let up. Chilam \n",
      "Sotz’ snored quietly in a hammock on the other side of the temple, appar-\n",

      "The food had helped, that and a long nap during the afternoon rain, \n",
      "while Chilam Sotz’ went off to do something he didn’t want to talk \n",
      "about. Eddie felt stronger, his brain a little clearer. He felt like pieces of \n",
      "his personality were slowly seeping back from some other place.\n",
      "He went outside and sat at the top of the steps, looking out at the night. \n",
      "Torches around the plaza shot off flames in long, rattling streamers as the \n",
      "wind whipped between the buildings. There were only a few guards. Most \n",
      "of the soldiers had gone to sleep wherever they’d been sitting.\n",
      "The wind moaned and a torch across the way flickered out. For a \n",
      "second Eddie thought he saw somebody moving in the darkness at the \n",
      "edge of the Palace. Shadows, he told himself.\n",
      "There were shadows in his head, too. The little monkey man. The city \n",
      "in ruins. A woman with yellow-brown hair.\n",
      "Eddie looked around and his heart jumped in fear. There was a man \n",
      "walking toward him from the side of the temple.\n",
      "He was naked except for a loincloth. He moved like he didn’t want \n",
      "to put his weight behind it, like he had broken pieces of obsidian un-\n",
      "derfoot. Instead of a spear he had a bow and a handful of arrows. Eddie \n",
      "blinked. None of the city soldiers had bows and arrows. Where had they \n",
      "come from?\n",
      "“You are Kukulcán?” the man asked.\n",
      "Eddie was still too shaken up to answer. A voice from behind him \n",
      "said, “Yes. He’s the one.”\n",
      "It was Chilam Sotz’, wrapped in his jaguar cloak. The wind pulled at \n",
      "his feathers and made the jaguar’s tail dance around. “Go with this man,” \n",
      "he said. “He’ll take you out of the city.”\n",
      "“He’s one of the others,” Eddie said. “The Haawo’.”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "“You’re helping them.”\n",
      "“I believe the vision you told me was true. No one can change the \n",
      "future. All anyone can do is try to be part of it. The ruler is finished. \n",
      "The city is finished. Even the gods, if they exist, are finished. Go with \n",
      "this man.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” Eddie said. He had a strange impulse to take Chilam \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 201\n",
      "Sotz’ right hand with his own right hand. He didn’t know why. “You \n",
      "are a hach winik.”\n",
      "Chilam Sotz’ smiled. There was some bitterness in it. “Go now,” he said.\n",
      "The Haawo’ led the way around the back of the temple and into the \n",
      "forest. The moon was nearly full and there was enough light to see by.\n",
      "“Where are we going?” Eddie whispered.\n",
      "“Quiet,” the man said. “Walk quietly.”\n",
      "Eddie could see the path if he didn’t look too hard for it. The Haawo’ \n",
      "was moving so fast Eddie had to keep breaking into a run to keep up. \n",
      "He wasn’t used to running in sandals and they felt like they were about \n",
      "to come off.\n",
      "They came out into the open near the top of the hill. Eddie could see \n",
      "the city laid out below him, flickering in the torchlight. In the second \n",
      "he spent looking at it his sandal slipped on a mossy rock. His feet went \n",
      "out from under him and he went down. A chunk of limestone clattered \n",
      "down the hill.\n",
      "Somebody shouted in the distance. “That way,” the Haawo’ said, \n",
      "pointing. “Run.” Eddie scrambled to his feet and ran into the trees \n",
      "again. For a little while he heard the other man behind him and then \n",
      "there were more shouts and he was running alone. He heard spears clat-\n",
      "tering together and more shouting. Two screams. One of them stopped \n",
      "in the middle and then there were a lot of running feet, all coming \n",
      "toward him.\n",
      "Eddie knew that his clumsiness had just killed a man. He couldn’t \n",
      "seem to take it seriously. This wasn’t his fight. He hadn’t asked to be \n",
      "taken out of the city. All he wanted was to keep himself alive.\n",
      "He got off the path, running in the wide spaces between the trees. \n",
      "He slowed down for a thicket of palms and felt a hand on his arm. \n",
      "He choked, nearly shouted, and then a dirty hand covered his mouth. \n",
      "“Quiet,” the voice said, and Eddie nodded.\n",
      "The hands let him go and he turned around. There were three of them, \n",
      "all young, dressed in loincloths. Their foreheads were shaved, but they let \n",
      "their hair fall loose on the sides instead of pulling it back in topknots.\n",
      "One of them pointed the way and started off. The other two got on ei-\n",

      "him again whenever he slowed down or missed a step. They weren’t being \n",
      "all that gentle and Eddie worried about what that might mean.\n",
      "202 lewis shiner\n",
      "Finally they came to a milpa. What few stalks of corn there were had \n",
      "been bent double to protect them from the rains. The ears were small \n",
      "and badly formed. Beyond the cornfield was a compound of five or six \n",
      "huts. Eddie could smell the smoke from the cookhouse fires.\n",
      "They brought him in through the central square. Women in long \n",
      "white peasant robes squatted in the dirt, holding their naked children. \n",
      "They all stared as the men hustled him by.\n",
      "“Can I get something to eat?” Eddie asked. “Some water, maybe?”\n",
      "“Not yet,” one of the men said. “You have to talk to the t’o’ohil.”\n",
      "All of the huts were on dirt platforms a couple of feet off the ground. \n",
      "It was enough to keep them from flooding during the rainy season. \n",
      "They all looked like the cooking hut back in the city: thatched roofs, \n",
      "a vertical row of sticks for walls. Eddie was exhausted and couldn’t get \n",
      "his breath. It hurt his calf muscles to climb up onto the platform of the \n",
      "t’o’ohil’s hut.\n",
      "One of the Haawo’ warriors pushed him through the door. There \n",
      "were half a dozen fires inside, burning in clay pots. The air was full of \n",
      "the pine smell of burning copal.\n",
      "On the far side of the clay pots was a tiny, wrinkled old man who \n",
      "looked like a monkey.\n",
      "“Hello, Eddie,” Chan Ma’ax said.\n",
      "T\n",

      "He’d been running for two hours, telling himself Carla’s people \n",
      "wouldn’t try to track him until morning, if at all. He told himself a lot \n",
      "of things. He told himself the big jungle predators had pretty much died \n",
      "out, that the few that were left would run from the noise he made.\n",
      "He was definitely making enough noise.\n",
      "Mostly he kept telling himself he was going to be okay, over and over, \n",
      "like a mantra. He had a gun, after all. Between the various homesteading \n",
      "Indians and the lumber and oil companies, there were roads everywhere. \n",
      "He was bound to find one sooner or later.\n",
      "The tree he found looked like some kind of oak. He slung the M16 \n",
      "and jumped up to grab the lowest branch. He hadn’t tried to climb a \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 203\n",
      "tree in years. The bark ripped at the skin inside his wrists and it was all \n",
      "he could do to swing his legs up and over the branch. He hung there, \n",
      "upside down, the blood running to his head, losing the feeling in his \n",
      "hands, and then desperately clambered up into the tree, tearing out the \n",
      "pocket of his shirt in the process.\n",
      "He finally settled in a thick cluster of limbs, his feet on one, ass on \n",
      "another, folded arms and head on a third. He even slept a little, for ten \n",
      "or fifteen minutes at a stretch, dreaming that he was still awake and \n",
      "staring out into the dark. He woke up at sunrise, shivering, his clothes \n",
      "drenched with dew. A column of tiny black ants had detoured across \n",
      "one knee. He stood up and slapped and brushed at them with his right \n",
      "hand, holding on with his left. His clothes were so wet that his hands \n",
      "came away beaded with water.\n",
      "His muscles ached and every inch of bare skin was covered with \n",
      "mosquito bites. He didn’t even have a canteen. He considered the idea \n",
      "of going back. To what? he thought. A firing squad? He wasn’t even sure \n",
      "he could find the way.\n",
      "He ended up chewing on his shirt for the moisture.\n",
      "Early in the afternoon he found a grove of wild orange trees. Their \n",
      "skins were mostly green and yellow, not the bright dyed orange Thomas \n",
      "was used to seeing in the grocery. The insides were sweet enough, \n",
      "though, and he ate what he could and bundled up another five or six in \n",
      "his shirt.\n",
      "Half a mile farther on he found the ruins of a stone house. He had \n",
      "no idea how old the place was. There was no roof left, but the beams \n",
      "were still in place. There was a layer of dirt over the stone floor and a \n",
      "few weeds and small trees growing up through it. Thomas kicked the \n",
      "plants down and scuffed the floor smooth with his boots. The sky was \n",
      "clouding up for the daily rainstorm. He gathered up enough leaves and \n",
      "branches to get half a roof onto the existing timbers. By then it had \n",
      "started to rain.\n",
      "With a few branches in front of the door he felt reasonably secure. \n",
      "His roof leaked a little, but the back corner stayed dry. He closed his \n",
      "eyes and told himself it was okay to sleep. It didn’t happen.\n",
      "He kept wondering who’d lived in the cabin, and what had become \n",
      "of them. They’d left nothing behind except the ruined house and the \n",
      "orange trees. If they’d built a road it was gone now. At least the Mayans \n",
      "had left something of themselves, art and writing and pottery and bones.\n",
      "204 lewis shiner\n",
      "But then the Mayans had been an entire civilization. Whoever had \n",
      "lived here hadn’t been more than a single family. Maybe just one person. \n",
      "And how much, Thomas thought, does anybody really leave behind?\n",
      "By the time the rain stopped he was asleep.\n",
      "He spent the second night there, and slept well enough, all \n",
      "things considered. He could have stayed another day or two if he’d \n",
      "been willing to live on oranges. So far he hadn’t seen another living \n",
      "creature. He’d heard birds and monkeys in the trees, but they’d stayed \n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "The sun came up behind the house. Thomas tried to fix its position \n",
      "in his mind relative to El Chichón, which he could still see in the dis-\n",
      "tance. He’d been headed west the day before. If he turned a little toward \n",
      "the north he should hit Usumacinta. From there he could find some \n",
      "way to get hold of Marsalis, warn him that there were civilian hostages \n",
      "at Na Chan, keep him from starting an attack.\n",
      "He slung his M16 over one shoulder and a new shirt full of oranges \n",
      "over the other. By nine o’clock he’d picked up a trail, and by ten the \n",
      "trail had crossed a logging road.\n",
      "One of Marsalis’s patrols found him before noon.\n",
      "He was replaying music in his brain, Motown, Talking Heads, any-\n",
      "thing with a good steady beat to keep his feet moving. Suddenly he was \n",
      "on his face in the dirt and his glasses were gone. He felt the M16 being \n",
      "jerked away from him and a knee in the middle of his back. He turned \n",
      "his head sideways to look.\n",
      "He couldn’t focus that well without his glasses, but it looked like his \n",
      "gun was sailing through the air. It was caught by a kid in baggy fatigue \n",
      "pants and an olive-drab T-shirt. Then a huge open hand, black at the \n",
      "fingers and lighter at the palm, pushed his face into the roadway.\n",
      "At first the only thing Thomas could think of was to wonder if he’d \n",
      "been singing out loud and making an idiot out of himself. He was so \n",
      "exhausted he couldn’t remember.\n",
      "He stared up through the fingers at the blur of a round, sweating Af-\n",
      "rican face. “You just lie there a minute, honey,” the man said. The M16 \n",
      "sailed through the air again. They were tossing it around like a baseball \n",
      "in the infield.\n",
      "“Where’d this hairball get a M16?” somebody said.\n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 205\n",

      "“What rebels?”\n",
      "“Carla.”\n",
      "There were wolf whistles and cheers. “I can’t wait to fuck that bitch,” \n",

      "“He ain’t lying,” Jamie said. “At least about Na Chan.” He took \n",

      "and the left side of his face. His glasses were right there in front of him. \n",
      "He got his shirt loose from the oranges and cleaned the glasses off. They \n",
      "seemed to be okay. He put them on and hung the shirt over his shoulders.\n",
      "There were five men in the patrol. None of them wore anything \n",
      "like a normal military uniform. Jamie had an M16, but the others all \n",

      "but Jamie said, “Okay, that’s a roger.” He put the receiver back on his \n",
      "belt. “All right, ladies, fall out.”\n",
      "The patrol sat down along one side of the road. Somebody lit a joint \n",
      "and passed it. The man next to Thomas took his turn and said, “Want  \n",
      "a hit?”\n",
      "“Thanks,” Thomas said. It burned his throat and made his stomach \n",
      "lurch but he felt calmer right away. When it came around again he took \n",
      "another, then a third. The last hit stoned him. His stomach felt like an \n",
      "open wound.\n",
      "“You guys got anything to eat?” he asked. A hefty white guy at the \n",
      "end passed him a Kit Kat and a canteen. Thomas started to drink and \n",
      "then hesitated at the smell. “What’s in here?”\n",
      "“Kool-Aid,” the guy on the end said. “Black cherry. Covers the \n",
      "taste of the goddamn iodine. Made with real sugar, too, none of that \n",
      "NutraSweet shit.”\n",
      "Thomas drank it with the candy. He felt 10 years old. The caffeine in \n",
      "the chocolate and all that sugar hit him like a dose of speed.\n",
      "About ten minutes later a jeep came up the road and stopped a few \n",
      "yards short of where Thomas was sitting. A cloud of dust hovered over \n",
      "the back of the jeep for a second and then slowly settled. A cartoon \n",
      "insignia on the side said fighting 666th. The driver was a beefy \n",
      "blond with shoulder-length hair in a headband and a few days’ growth \n",
      "of beard. Next to him was an elegant-looking black man in khakis and a \n",
      "dress cap with two eagles over the bill. Marsalis, Thomas thought. There \n",
      "was a civilian in the backseat, a kid with dark blond razor-cut hair and a \n",
      "mustache. He had the kind of pampered good looks and thin, muscular \n",
      "body that Thomas associated with California, with the record promo \n",
      "people that used to follow Eddie around.\n",

      "Rolling Stone write about what he was doing? Carmichael wasn’t taking \n",
      "any notes and he didn’t have a camera or recorder with him. Something \n",
      "else was going on here, but Thomas couldn’t figure it out yet. Billy, \n",

      "“How many of you people does Carla have up there, anyway?” \n",
      "Marsalis asked.\n",

      "two of the uh-is were staked down against the wind, one rotor lashed \n",
      "to the rear of the fuselage. The third Huey was the one that had buzzed \n",

      "“One of the rebels mentioned it. What’s the story?”\n",

      "How much longer could he put it off? They were headed north and \n",
      "west, almost directly away from Na Chan. Every minute took them \n",
      "farther in the wrong direction.\n",
      "He let his right hand drift down until it touched the cool metal of \n",
      "the wrench.\n",
      "Fowler kept swiveling his head, looking constantly in all directions. \n",
      "Vietnam reflexes, Thomas supposed. He made himself think about Lind-\n",

      "out of there. That bastard Marsalis...\n",
      "He waited until Fowler’s head was turned completely to the left. \n",
      "Now! he thought, and tried to bring the wrench around, but suddenly \n",
      "it weighed a hundred pounds and he couldn’t lift it.\n",
      "I can’t do this, he thought. He shut his eyes. If he looked in the back \n",
      "he would see Carmichael, waiting. Carmichael who’d done his part, \n",
      "already taken his risks.\n",
      "I’m going to count to ten, he thought. It was the way he used to get \n",
      "himself out of bed on cold mornings. One. Two. He opened his eyes.\n",
      "Three. His right hand came up with the wrench in it. Chrome, \n",
      "gleaming. Four.\n",
      "Fowler turned, saw the wrench. “What the hell?”\n",
      "Thomas lunged at him. The wrench bounced feebly off Fowler’s \n",
      "headset, knocking the mirrored sunglasses partway off. The helicopter \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 215\n",
      "lurched into a sideways dive as Fowler’s hands came off the controls. \n",
      "Thomas could barely move, held in by the straps on his seat. He \n",
      "switched the wrench to his left hand and swung again, grabbing the \n",
      "cyclic and pulling it back to neutral with his right. Fowler’s glasses hung \n",
      "by one stem now.\n",
      "Fowler blinked, stunned but not unconscious. Blood trickled out of \n",
      "a cut on his forehead. Thomas got his seatbelts off. He felt like he was \n",
      "drugged or dreaming. Fowler’s hand twitched at the flap on his holster. \n",
      "Thomas hit him in the wrist with the wrench.\n",
      "Before he could pull the gun out himself Carmichael was there. “Watch \n",
      "the controls, for God’s sake!” Carmichael shouted. “I’ve got the gun!”\n",
      "Thomas spun in his seat. They’d been falling longer than he real-\n",
      "ized. The tops of the trees were rushing up at them. He dropped the \n",
      "wrench and pulled the collective up with his left hand, adding throttle \n",
      "as he pulled. He forgot to compensate for the extra torque and the nose \n",
      "started to swing around.\n",
      "“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Carmichael shouted .\n",
      "“Shut up!” Thomas shouted back. He should have taken Oscar up \n",
      "on his offer to fly the Huey out of San Cristóbal. It had been years. \n",
      "The machine seemed cumbersome and underpowered compared to \n",
      "the project’s sleek little Robinson. He finally got them leveled off and \n",
      "started looking for a place to set down.\n",
      "He risked a quick glance at Fowler. Carmichael was holding a .38 \n",
      "revolver against the man’s head. Fowler kept blinking. Thomas couldn’t \n",
      "stand to look at it. “If you have to shoot,” Thomas said, “make sure it \n",
      "doesn’t go through the instruments.” He said it to convince Fowler how \n",
      "bloodthirsty they were. In fact he doubted if Fowler could even hear him.\n",
      "They’d been following a dirt road. Thomas picked it up again and \n",
      "spotted a deserted crossroads that was big enough to set down in. He \n",
      "landed the Huey as cautiously as he knew how and still bounced a little \n",
      "on the skids.\n",
      "“Get him out,” he said. The vibration of the levers kept Carmichael \n",
      "from seeing how badly his hands were shaking. He was so pumped up \n",
      "he could hardly stay in the seat.\n",
      "Carmichael worked the left-hand door open, then crawled around \n",
      "to where he could shove Fowler out with his foot. Fowler tumbled out \n",
      "into the dirt and lay on his side, still blinking.\n",
      "“I think there’s something wrong with him,” Carmichael said.\n",
      "216 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Shut the door,” Thomas said.\n",
      "Carmichael shut the door and strapped himself in Fowler’s seat.\n",
      "Thomas lifted them off again. “He’s alive,” he said. “That’s all he gets.”\n",
      "He looked back to make sure Fowler was still lying in the road and \n",
      "not hanging on the skids. Then he waited until they were another mile \n",
      "or so away before he turned them back toward the southeast. He was \n",
      "not taking any chances.\n",
      "After a couple of minutes Thomas gave Carmichael a headset and \n",
      "showed him how to work the footswitch for the intercom.\n",
      "“Where are you going?” Carmichael said.\n",
      "“Na Chan.”\n",
      "“Listen. I have to get this story turned in. It can’t wait.”\n",
      "“And I have to try to get those people out of Na Chan.”\n",
      "“Do you really think they’ll let you just come in and take them?”\n",
      "“I have to try,” Thomas said. “And that means I can’t risk dropping \n",
      "you off. If somebody spots this helicopter they might decide to just \n",
      "shoot me down.” He looked at Carmichael. “I’m sorry. This is life and \n",
      "death.”\n",
      "Carmichael still had the gun in his hand. Thomas looked at the gun \n",
      "and back at Carmichael.\n",
      "“Just yesterday,” Carmichael said, “I was thinking I would kill to get \n",
      "this story filed.” He took the bullets out of the gun and threw it in the \n",
      "back. “I guess I was wrong.”\n",

      "L\n",
      "indsey spent the night under the ramada again, though \n",
      "she was sure now that Thomas wouldn’t be back. He was probably \n",
      "dead. She couldn’t manage to feel much of anything. \n",
      "Ramos started the new regime at dawn. He put everybody to work \n",
      "except Eddie, who was obviously too sick to bother with. Dying, Lindsey \n",
      "thought. It was one more thing she couldn’t stand to think about. \n",
      "She and Oscar and the Lacandones were issued entrenching tools, \n",
      "little shovels with blades that folded down so they could be used like \n",
      "picks. Ramos’ first priority was making the ruins defensible, which \n",
      "meant trenches around the perimeters. \n",
      "By 10:00 her hands looked like raw steak. She stank and her clothes \n",
      "were covered with mud. Ramos hadn’t even let her cut her fingernails \n",
      "and so she’d broken at least half of them, a couple right down to the \n",
      "quick. At first she’d thought the little shovels were cute. Now she hated \n",
      "them with a passion second only to the hatred she felt for Ramos. Her \n",
      "head ached from the constant shocks of the entrenching tool hitting rock. \n",
      "By noon she couldn’t do any more. She crawled out of the hole and \n",
      "sat under a tree and used all the strength she had left to keep from cry-\n",
      "ing. It was a matter of principle. \n",
      "There were four others in the trench with her, two boys and two \n",
      "girls, all of them around 16. The kid guarding them was maybe 20, but \n",
      "he had the jeans and khaki shirt of seniority. His name was Rigoberto. \n",
      "“You can’t work no more?” he asked her in English. \n",
      "“No,” she said. She showed him her hands. \n",
      "“You know where la cocina is? You know, comida and everything?” \n",
      "“The kitchen,” she said. “Yes.” \n",
      "“There is woman name Graciela. Una vieja. You say, is okay you work \n",
      "for her. Okay?”\n",
      "“Okay,” she said. “Thank you.” Now she was really close to crying. The \n",
      "pain of getting up kept her from feeling the full impact of his kindness.\n",
      "The old woman had her take food and water around to the workers. \n",
      "The food was orange slices and fried strips of banana-like plátano. She \n",
      "217\n",
      "218 lewis shiner\n",
      "carried everything in recycled, industrial-size tin cans. No one seemed \n",
      "to be watching her too closely. She timed it so that when the rain came \n",
      "she was close to Eddie’s tent. She made a break for it and crawled inside. \n",
      "Eddie was gone. She tried at first to tell herself that he was down at \n",
      "the swimming hole or with the Lacandones, but she knew better. He \n",
      "had taken the mushroom again. She sat and listened to the rain. Even \n",
      "if she found him in time, she thought, even if she slapped the damned \n",
      "stuff out of his hands, it wouldn’t do any good. Even sex hadn’t been \n",
      "able to call him back. He was lost. \n",
      "That’s it, Eddie, she thought. You’ve done it to me one too many times.\n",
      "It suddenly came to her that everything she’d ever done had been \n",
      "because of a man. From going on the road with Eddie at 17 to not \n",
      "being able to keep that kitten last year because she was dating a guy \n",
      "with allergies. From the way she dressed and wore her hair to keeping \n",
      "Budweiser in her refrigerator back in San Diego. To being here in the \n",
      "middle of Nowhere, Mexico, because of Eddie again. It was simple and \n",
      "obvious, but she’d never put it in exactly those terms before. The real-\n",
      "ization made her cheeks hot with shame. \n",
      "The only thing I ever wanted for myself, she thought, was to have a kid. \n",
      "And then she thought, be careful what you wish for. Because it could \n",
      "be happening, right now. \n",
      "It was an hour after the rain that they heard the helicopter. \n",
      "She was at the northern edge of the ruins. There was only a single \n",
      "trench there. Everybody expected the attack to come out of the west, \n",
      "where there was level ground, but Ramos wasn’t taking any chances. \n",
      "All day there had been this sense of doom and when they heard the \n",
      "helicopter everybody stopped what they were doing and looked at each \n",
      "other and then looked up at the sky. \n",
      "Lindsey flashed on her ninth birthday, October 24, 1962. It was just \n",
      "two days since the President had told Castro to get rid of his Soviet \n",
      "missiles. Everybody thought there was going to be war. She remem-\n",
      "bered being at school, out on the red dirt playground, looking up and \n",
      "seeing the biggest plane she’d ever seen. There just weren’t that many \n",
      "planes over Athens, Texas in 1962, let alone anything that size. She’d just \n",
      "stood there, too afraid even to run, burning with the injustice of being \n",
      "only 9 years old and about to die. \n",
      "She was no more ready now than she had been when she was 9. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 219\n",
      "It was just one helicopter, coming in low and slow from the north. \n",
      "My life has prepared me for this, Lindsey thought. From the Cuban \n",
      "missile crisis to the Vietnam War on tv, she had been taught that death \n",
      "came out of the sky and there was nowhere to run to get away. \n",
      "When she saw the white flag hanging out the window it was almost \n",
      "an anticlimax. It was Thomas, she realized. Who else could it be? He’d \n",
      "come to get her out. She dropped the cans and ran toward the clearing \n",
      "where the helicopter was setting down.\n",
      "Ramos and Faustino and another ten or so rebels were already \n",
      "there. All of them but Ramos had their guns pointed at the cabin of \n",
      "the helicopter, waiting for the men inside to come out. Ramos didn’t \n",
      "carry a rifle anymore, just the pistol he’d used to shoot Gordo through \n",
      "the head. \n",
      "Lindsey saw Oscar in the shadow of the ramada. Near him was a \n",
      "middle-aged woman in a striped dress. She had two kids, both of them \n",
      "less than 3 years old. Each had hold of one of her hands. She watched \n",
      "the helicopter with tired patience and no curiosity. \n",
      "Thomas got out of the right side of the helicopter. He had both \n",
      "hands up about shoulder-high. He started talking in Spanish. “I have \n",
      "news,” is what he said. “I have to see Carla.” \n",
      "Ramos answered him. Lindsey got the gist of it. He said that Carla \n",
      "had stepped down. He now found himself, apparently to his own sur-\n",
      "prise, thrust into the position of leadership. \n",
      "Lindsey took a couple of steps toward Thomas. He looked over at \n",
      "her and it was obvious from his face that he knew about her and Eddie. \n",
      "That stopped her, and she kept her distance, waiting on the edge of the \n",
      "growing crowd. \n",
      "Oscar came over to stand next to her. For a second she was afraid he \n",
      "would do something stupid like put his arm around her. He had gotten \n",
      "used to translating for her, which was in its own way a relationship. One \n",
      "where she was dependent and he had all the cards. \n",
      "But she had underestimated him. All he wanted to know was if she \n",
      "was okay. She showed him her hands. “Except for these,” she said. “You \n",
      "all right?” \n",
      "“I guess. That soldier, Porter? He died last night. Ramos was trying to \n",
      "make him talk. Tried a little too hard, I guess.” \n",
      "“I’m sorry,” Lindsey said. “I never even saw him.”\n",
      "220 lewis shiner\n",
      "“He was a piece of shit,” Oscar said. “That doesn’t make me like \n",
      "Ramos any better.” \n",
      "Another man got out of the helicopter. He was very good-looking, \n",
      "in a soap-opera kind of way. Blond hair over his ears, mustache, hik-\n",
      "ing shorts and boots that looked childish in the jungle, a gray Mickey \n",
      "Mouse T-shirt that only made it worse. He couldn’t have been more \n",
      "than 25. \n",
      "“Teniente Ramos,” the man said, with a certain nervousness. “¿Como va?” \n",
      "Teniente, Lindsey thought, meant lieutenant. She wasn’t sure how high \n",
      "Ramos had promoted himself, but he obviously didn’t like being called \n",
      "by his former rank. He nodded, his head moving maybe a quarter of an \n",
      "inch, and said, “El estimado Señor Carmichael.” \n",
      "“Faustino,” Carmichael said. He put his hand out and Faustino took \n",
      "it, a little reluctantly, Lindsey thought. \n",
      "Then Thomas and Ramos got into it. Lindsey heard her own name, \n",
      "and Eddie’s, but couldn’t make much out of the rest. “Thomas says \n",
      "Marsalis is attacking in a few hours,” Oscar said. “Sometime after dark.”\n",
      "“Who’s Marsalis?” Lindsey asked.\n",
      "“He’s running the US show down here,” Oscar said.\n",
      "Lindsey nodded, suddenly lightheaded.\n",
      "“Thomas wants to get us out,” Oscar said. “I get the idea the pretty \n",
      "boy is some kind of journalist. Interviewed Carla a couple weeks ago. \n",
      "Thomas says if we all get out it’ll do the revolution more good than \n",
      "keeping us here.” \n",
      "“What’s Ramos saying?” \n",
      "“About what you’d expect. Impossible. Can’t be done. He says \n",
      "Thomas should fly the helicopter against Marsalis. Which Thomas says \n",
      "he won’t do.” Oscar smiled at her without humor. “It’s what we used to \n",
      "call in Texas a Mexican standoff.”\n",
      "Ramos turned and looked through the crowd. He stopped when he \n",
      "got to Lindsey. “You,” he said in Spanish. “Come here.” \n",
      "“Maybe he’s going to make a deal,” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“I fucking doubt it,” Oscar said. He followed along behind as the \n",
      "rebels got out of her way. They looked less like soldiers than prison-\n",
      "ers on a road gang. A lot of them were stripped to the waist and wore \n",
      "sweaty bandanas around their heads or necks. There were a lot of bad \n",
      "vibes going around. It must have had to do with the look on Ramos’ \n",
      "face. He looked scared as much as anything, like he was operating on \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 221\n",
      "nerve and instinct rather than brains. Meanwhile everybody else was \n",
      "moving away from him, leaving five or six feet of open space between \n",
      "him and Thomas. \n",
      "She stood in front of Ramos. He made a stirring motion in the air \n",
      "with his index finger. He wanted her to turn around. \n",
      "She turned around. It was very quiet. She could hear the wind in \n",
      "the leaves across the clearing. Ramos put both hands on her shoulders, \n",
      "pushing her to her knees. \n",
      "She let it happen. There were men with guns all around. Ramos took \n",
      "his right hand away. His left hand stayed on her shoulder. She heard a \n",
      "snap, then the sound of metal moving against leather. She felt the barrel \n",
      "of his gun against her ear. \n",
      "Ramos was talking again. She couldn’t hear him. There was a noise \n",
      "like running water inside her head. She kept seeing Gordo’s face as \n",
      "the bullet hit. She looked at Thomas, waiting for him to explain what \n",
      "Ramos was saying. He wouldn’t meet her eyes. She looked at Oscar. \n",
      "When she turned her head it pushed the barrel of the gun into her skin. \n",
      "“He says,” Oscar said, “that...that if Thomas doesn’t fly the helicopter, \n",
      "he will kill you.”\n",
      "She had never been able to imagine herself dying. If she were \n",
      "dead, whose eyes would she see it through? When she tried to picture \n",
      "it, it turned into a movie. The camera slowly pulling away. But she knew \n",
      "movies weren’t real. \n",
      "If she could have imagined it, she might have been more afraid. \n",
      "Instead she was just angry. She was tired of being treated like what she \n",
      "thought and what she felt weren’t important. She reached up and put \n",
      "her hand around the barrel of the gun. Her hand was weak and shaking, \n",
      "but that could have been anger as much as fear. \n",
      "She pushed the gun away. \n",
      "Ramos was too startled to react. She stood up. “Tell him,” she said \n",
      "to Thomas. She was shaking all over, even her shoulders were shaking. \n",
      "“You tell him. Tell him no.” Her voice was high and trembling, like a \n",
      "quiet scream. The tears she’d been holding back all day ran down her \n",
      "face. “If he’s going to shoot me he can just go ahead and do it. But he’s \n",
      "not using me. I won’t be used. You tell him that!” She wanted to slap \n",
      "Thomas across the face to make sure he’d heard her. \n",
      "“¿Mande?” Ramos said behind her. “¿Qué dice?” \n",
      "222 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Tell him,” she said, and walked away. Oscar stood aside for her. She \n",
      "didn’t care if Ramos shot her or not. She really didn’t. She was not go-\n",
      "ing to be humiliated anymore because of men’s games. They could kill \n",
      "her, but she was by God not going to play anymore. \n",
      "She was halfway to Carla’s tent when she realized she wasn’t dead. \n",
      "No one had even followed her. They couldn’t, she thought. She’d \n",
      "gone off in a direction perpendicular to their universe. She was giddy \n",
      "with relief. I must have turned invisible, she thought. Simply disap-\n",
      "peared from their world. \n",
      "She went into Carla’s tent. She wasn’t sure exactly what had brought \n",
      "her there but when she actually saw Carla something came loose inside \n",
      "her. She sat on the edge of the cot and felt blindly for Carla’s hand. \n",
      "She started to laugh and cry, taking turns, no more than a few sec-\n",
      "onds of each at a time. She was free for the first time in her life. And \n",
      "in a few hours Marsalis would arrive and she would die anyway. Carla \n",
      "shifted on the cot, sitting up, and slowly took Lindsey in her arms. \n",
      "Lindsey put her forehead against Carla’s neck and closed her eyes and \n",
      "let herself be comforted. \n",
      "Finally she sat up, got out her handkerchief and wiped her face and \n",
      "blew her nose. She held on to Carla’s right hand with her left. \n",
      "Carla had changed. It wasn’t the amputation that had been killing her, \n",
      "Lindsey realized. It was the pressure of being in command. Now that it \n",
      "was off her she looked rested, stronger. She almost seemed to glow. But \n",
      "then everything was glowing. The air was full of smells and the touch of \n",
      "the earth, even through her shoes and the floor of the tent, felt vibrant \n",
      "and alive. \n",
      "“Thomas regresa,” Lindsey said. Her accent was bad and she wasn’t \n",
      "sure she’d used the right ending on the verb. She would take it slow and \n",
      "Carla would understand. \n",
      "“¿Está solo?” \n",
      "“No,” Lindsey said. “Con journalista.” Carla shook her head. What was \n",
      "the word? “Periodista.” \n",
      "“Ah,” Carla said. “¿El chico de Rolling Stone? ¿Muy guapo?” \n",
      "Lindsey shrugged. She pointed at Carla. “Y tú,” she said. “¿Estas mejor?” \n",
      "Carla nodded. “Sí, me siento mucho mejor. Anoche, dormí toda la noche.” \n",
      "She pantomimed sleep with a hand on her cheek and closed eyes. “La \n",
      "primera vez en...muchas semanas.” The first time in weeks. \n",
      "Lindsey nodded. The emotional upheaval and the awkward \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 223\n",
      "conversation had tired her. She wondered if she should mention \n",
      "Marsalis, the coming attack. Would it do any good? Before she could \n",
      "make up her mind she heard voices outside. \n",
      "Thomas came in, followed by Ramos and a couple of other rebels. \n",
      "Thomas looked at Lindsey and then looked away again. “We have to \n",
      "talk,” he said to Carla in Spanish. \n",
      "“Claro,” Carla said. Lindsey squeezed Carla’s hand and went to stand \n",
      "on the other side of the tent. Ramos rattled off a string of Spanish at \n",
      "Carla and she waved at him to be quiet. \n",
      "Thomas started a complicated explanation. While he talked, Oscar, \n",
      "then Faustino and Carmichael came in as well. Between them there was \n",
      "barely room to move around. Thomas had his back to her, but she could \n",
      "see Carla’s face. Lindsey watched her go through five or six emotions, \n",
      "fighting the whole time to keep them from showing. \n",
      "“What is it?” she asked Oscar. “What’s going on?” \n",

      "at the mouth of the gun that had been against her head just minutes \n",
      "before. How could one hand hold something so enormous? \n",
      "Faustino got both hands on Ramos’ arm, pulling it down. Something \n",
      "exploded. Lindsey had shut her eyes without meaning to. When she \n",
      "opened them she thought she would see blood running down the front \n",
      "of her shirt. Instead there was a hole in the canvas at her feet and three \n",

      "They held ramos down while Oscar explained about Gordo. \n",
      "Before he finished Faustino had the pistol in his own hand and was \n",
      "holding it to Ramos’ temple. He had a handful of Ramos’ hair and was \n",
      "pushing the man’s face into the tent floor. Lindsey was glad she didn’t \n",
      "have to see his eyes. \n",
      "She sat down on a crate near the door. She felt like she was about to \n",
      "pass out. \n",

      "except Faustino. \n",

      "were by Carla’s cot. Oscar crouched down and translated quietly. \n",
      "“Faustino wants to know is she going to lead them again. She says \n",
      "maybe. Faustino says no more mystical bullshit. She says no, no more. \n",
      "Thomas says Marsalis is coming in just a few hours, will she let us go. \n",
      "She says no. She wants Thomas to fly the copter, just to observe, to give \n",

      "“Shit,” Oscar said. He stood up and took a couple of nervous steps, \n",
      "turning his back to all of them. He put his hands in his pockets and \n",
      "kicked at a seam in the floor. Thomas, apparently, was willing to let the \n",

      "Carla and Faustino got excited and there was a lot of talking back and \n",
      "forth. Lindsey got a word or two here and there, not enough to under-\n",
      "stand it all but enough that she didn’t feel completely helpless. \n",
      "Nobody is completely helpless, she thought. This is what I learned today. \n",
      "Carla got up and leaned on her crutch. Lindsey stood up too. Oscar \n",

      "“Hell yes. Put me on the next anything out of here.” He came over \n",
      "to shake Lindsey’s hand. “Nice meeting you, I guess. Such as it was. You \n",

      "She could hear the whine of the cicadas and, far off, a parrot screaming. \n",
      "“You okay?” Thomas asked her. There was a flatness to his voice that \n",
      "said he was concerned, but only to a point. \n",
      "226 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Yeah,” she said. “I’m okay.” \n",
      "“Where’s Eddie?” He said it in a way that wasn’t quite bitter. Like he \n",

      "“The mushrooms.” \n",
      "“You got it.” \n",
      "“Christ, of all the stupid...” He left it hanging. “Carla wants us out of \n",

      "“Safe? What’s going to be safe from rockets and helicopters and artillery?” \n",
      "“Well,” Thomas said, “Carla thought maybe the Temple of the \n",

      "Lindsey sat outside the door of the temple, looking down the \n",
      "stone terraces of the pyramid. Thomas was sitting in the doorway be-\n",

      "their last cigars with great formality. The room was full of their sour \n",
      "smoke. Two of Carla’s men had brought Eddie from the mushroom \n",

      "folded over his chest. \n",
      "Down in the clearing a couple of soldiers dismantled the machine \n",
      "gun from Thomas’s helicopter and carried it off at a run. “That’s the \n",
      "deal Faustino made with Oscar,” Thomas said. “He takes the machine \n",
      "gun and two soldiers with him. Faustino says it’s for self-defense. I think \n",
      "everybody knows there’s going to be some shooting.” \n",
      "“Are they going to be okay?” Lindsey asked. \n",
      "“Who the hell knows?” \n",
      "A few minutes later they heard the engine of Oscar’s helicopter crank \n",
      "and start to turn. After another minute or so it rose slowly out of the \n",
      "underbrush. “Yeah!” Thomas whispered, making a fist and holding it \n",
      "chest high. “All right!” \n",
      "“If they couldn’t fix Oscar’s they could always take that one,” Lindsey \n",
      "said, nodding to the helicopter in the clearing. “Or were you going to \n",
      "change your mind after all?” \n",
      "“I don’t know,” Thomas said. She’d expected sarcasm or anger, but \n",
      "instead he was very quiet. “I may have killed somebody today,” he said. \n",
      "“Hitting him in the head with a wrench.” \n",
      "“Jesus.” \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 227\n",
      "“That’s how I got away from Marsalis.” He was quiet again for a few \n",
      "seconds. “It was different than you would think. It was clumsy and nasty \n",
      "and scary as hell. But the worst thing was that part of me liked it.” He \n",
      "toyed with the laces of his tennis shoes. “Whenever I’m not thinking \n",
      "about anything else I keep seeing that guy’s face. So I don’t know if I’m \n",
      "really up for any more heroics today.” \n",
      "She didn’t notice Chan Zapata standing behind them until he said, \n",
      "“Tomás. My father wants to talk to you.” \n",

      "robes, Chan Zapata tall and smooth-faced and earnest, Chan Ma’ax \n",
      "withered and vaguely malevolent, like some kind of cosmic bag lady. \n",
      "“My father wants me translate for you. Make sure you understand.” \n",
      "Thomas scooted out of the doorway and Lindsey made room for him \n",
      "next to her. They all sat in a row in the afternoon sunlight. There were only \n",
      "two rebels around that she could see, sitting in the cargo doors of the heli-\n",
      "copter, making sure that Thomas didn’t just get in it and fly it away again. \n",
      "“My father says your brother supposed to come back. But he doesn’t \n",
      "come back. My father says somebody has to go and get him.”\n",
      "“Go get him?” Thomas said. So far Chan Ma’ax hadn’t said any-\n",
      "thing himself. Lindsey was starting to wonder if this was all some weird \n",
      "plot on Chan Zapata’s part. Then Chan Ma’ax held out his hand. In his \n",
      "palm was something brownish and wrinkled, like a piece of marshmal-\n",
      "low that had fallen in the dirt. \n",
      "It looked so harmless. It was hard for Lindsey to imagine that the act \n",
      "of a second or two, of putting that little piece of fungus into her mouth, \n",
      "chewing and swallowing, could change her life beyond hope of rescue. \n",
      "It was like looking down at a pit viper in an open-topped cage. \n",
      "She could tell that Thomas felt it too, from the look on his face. “First \n",
      "of all,” he said, his voice straining, “why should I be able to come back \n",
      "when Eddie can’t?” \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax mumbled something and Chan Zapata said, “You are \n",
      "strong and Eddie is weak. You hold on very strong to what you think is \n",
      "real. Eddie, he can’t do that now.” \n",
      "“I thought it wasn’t any good if you took it away from where it \n",
      "grows. From the other mushrooms.” \n",
      "Chan Zapata answered without checking with his father. “This is \n",
      "sacred place again. Made finished again. It has power here.” \n",
      "228 lewis shiner\n",

      "to be talked into doing it. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax looked at Thomas. “Not crazy,” he said in English. \n",
      "Chan Zapata said, “You know it makes sense. You know what kind of \n",
      "sense it makes. The only thing wrong is I should be the one to take it.” \n",
      "“Go ahead,” Thomas said. He pushed Chan Ma’ax’s open hand to-\n",
      "ward Chan Zapata. “Be my guest.” \n",
      "“No,” Chan Ma’ax said. He closed his fist, brought the hand around \n",
      "until it was in front of Thomas and then opened it again. \n",
      "“Why not?” Lindsey said. “Chan Zapata, why won’t he let you take it?” \n",
      "“He says there is other plans for me. He says is not for me. He won’t \n",
      "tell me any more.” \n",
      "“Thomas?” Lindsey said. “You’re not really thinking about doing this, \n",
      "are you? Tell me you’re not thinking about it.”\n",
      "“Why not?” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Because it’s poison. Remember saying that? Look what it did to \n",
      "Eddie. Nobody else can fly that helicopter, and you can’t fly it if you’re \n",
      "tripping. It’s our only hope of getting out of here.” \n",
      "Thomas shook his head. “That helicopter’s no good to us now. There’s \n",

      "“Even if it wasn’t addictive, even if it wasn’t going to make you sick \n",

      "“The doctors didn’t help that kid on the dig twelve years ago,” Thomas \n",

      "okay. It’s true what Chan Zapata said. Eddie’s out of it. Mentally and \n",

      "“I can’t do anything about the guns and bullets and bombs. What if \n",

      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 229\n",
      "“That’s all it would be. Another dream. Meanwhile this place gets \n",

      "Chan Ma’ax had just been sitting there all this time, holding out the \n",
      "piece of mushroom. Thomas took it from him and walked away across \n",
      "the broad, flat top of the pyramid. He went right to the edge and stared \n",
      "at the forest. \n",
      "Lindsey followed him. The closest trees were only a few feet away, \n",
      "on the slope behind the pyramid. She could look straight out into \n",
      "their upper branches. From a distance they looked like stacks of dark \n",
      "green cumulus clouds, but up close they were random, chaotic, shad-\n",
      "owy and frightening. \n",

      "low and a light breeze puffed up out of the north. “Well, guess what? \n",
      "There’s no secret. You live and work and you have kids or don’t have \n",
      "kids and then you die. That’s all.” \n",
      "Thomas shook his head. “No. The work has to mean something. \n",
      "You have to be able to find your place in things, to know that it means \n",
      "something. You have to connect with other people. What about love, for \n",
      "God’s sake?” \n",
      "He was walking on the edge of all the unsaid things they still had \n",
      "between them. This seemed like a really lousy time to bring them up.\n",
      "“What about it?” she said. “For men love is wanting to get laid. For \n",
      "women love is wanting to have somebody’s kids. The rest is ego and \n",
      "power games and kidding yourself. That’s no secret of life.” \n",
      "Thomas shook his head. “Not a secret like that. Just a feeling. Like \n",
      "when you’re really stoned sometimes and everything seems to make \n",
      "sense. That kind of answer. Seeing the pattern. That’s what Prigogine’s \n",

      "“What does any of that have to do with eating a poisonous mushroom?” \n",

      "Chan Ma’ax and the rest of the Indians and his comatose brother. \n",
      "The temple was a long, narrow rectangle of limestone blocks, \n",
      "taking up most of the top of the pyramid. It was walled off into three \n",
      "rooms. The middle one was in the best shape, with the stone floor \n",
      "cleaned smooth and the roof completely rebuilt. That was where the \n",
      "Lacandones were. \n",
      "Lindsey sat outside, as far away from them as she could get, her \n",
      "back to the long drop-off and the face of the Snake God below. She \n",
      "watched Thomas and Chan Zapata as they carried Eddie into the \n",
      "empty chamber nearest her. Thomas looked at her once or twice but \n",
      "she turned away and wouldn’t meet his eyes. He went back into the \n",
      "middle room.\n",
      "It was getting dark. The wind blew her hair around and brought her \n",
      "the smell of flowers out of the jungle. She wondered if it always had to \n",
      "be like this, that her feelings could only be this intense under some kind \n",
      "of dire threat. \n",
      "A few minutes later Thomas and Chan Zapata came out. Thomas \n",
      "was wearing a Mayan robe and smiling halfheartedly, turning his \n",
      "head sideways and blinking like there was something in his eye. They \n",
      "went into the room where Eddie was and only Chan Zapata came \n",
      "out again. \n",
      "It was completely dark now, quieter than it had been in days. The \n",
      "insects, she realized. She couldn’t hear the insects anymore. \n",
      "She got up, started back toward the safety of the temple. A noise \n",
      "came out of the sky. It sounded like somebody trying to suck up the \n",
      "last bit of milkshake through a straw, only louder. She knew what \n",
      "it was. She’d grown up hearing it on the evening news. Incoming \n",
      "mortar fire. She looked up but she couldn’t see anything. The noise \n",
      "faded. She kept waiting for her heart to start beating again. A second \n",
      "later there was a flash over by the ball court and a quiet thump, like \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 231\n",
      "somebody flattening an empty beer can. The pyramid shook under \n",
      "her feet. \n",
      "It had started.\n",
      "E\n",

      "end of the cycle, from the time when the city lay in ruins. The \n",
      "only thing was, he was younger than Eddie remembered him, by ten or \n",
      "fifteen years. And he didn’t look exactly like the other Chan Ma’ax. He \n",
      "was taller, with a broader nose. But Eddie recognized him just the same. \n",
      "“Your name is Eddie, yes?” Chan Ma’ax said. “Chilam Sotz’ said that \n",
      "is what you first called yourself.” \n",
      "“Then you don’t know me,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“Not yet,” Chan Ma’ax said. “But I will. I will meet you in the \n",

      "“I know you,” Eddie said. “Your name is Chan Ma’ax. Isn’t it?” \n",
      "“Yes. This is the body of my ancestor, but right now, inside, it is me. \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax. Eddie, you must go back there.” \n",
      "“Back?” \n",
      "“Back where you came from. Back to the other time.” Eddie shook \n",
      "his head. “Sit down and listen to me,” Chan Ma’ax said. Eddie sat \n",
      "cross-legged on the dirt floor. “You ate a mushroom. You are having \n",
      "a dream. It is called hach pixan, the true dream. In the other time you \n",
      "are asleep right now. Your mind has come here and is walking around \n",
      "in a body from this time. You are dreaming, but you are seeing true \n",
      "things, you understand?” \n",
      "“And you’re dreaming too,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“Yes, I’m dreaming too. But now you must stop dreaming and do the \n",

      "“I don’t know what you mean.” \n",

      "“That’s because you are ts’ul, a foreigner. You don’t understand time.” \n",
      "The old man dropped more knots of copal onto the coals. The incense \n",
      "232 lewis shiner\n",

      "next day is 2 Ik.” He moved clockwise around the circles and made an-\n",

      "“Slow down,” Eddie said. “I don’t understand.” \n",

      "in different combinations. One Ix, 2 Men, 3 Cib. All the way to 7 Ahau, \n",
      "and then you’ve used up all the names. So you keep going with the \n",
      "numbers but you start the names again. Eight lmix, 9 Ix, and so on. You \n",

      "“I guess. But what does this have to do with finding my way back to \n",
      "the other time?” \n",
      "“Everything. Pay attention. You have the two little wheels here. These \n",

      "his right index finger. “It is known.” \n",
      "Eddie rubbed his forehead. The smoke and the weight of the new \n",

      "“No,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“Then I will say this. Some people the mushroom calls. It can bring \n",

      "“You wanted to know where you belong in the world, no?” \n",
      "Eddie shrugged. \n",
      "“The world is all of us. We all have a place. We all have things we \n",
      "must do. The purpose of the world is to move through the cycles and \n",
      "become better. To become new again. You have a part of this that is \n",
      "yours. You come from the time of the xu’tan. The end of the world.” \n",
      "“Is this another joke?” Eddie said. “When you say the end of the \n",

      "“The end of the cycle. Not the little circles like I drew before, but \n",
      "the great cycle. There were four worlds before this one. This is the fifth. \n",

      "236 lewis shiner\n",
      "There must have been close to hundred men there, standing in  \n",

      "run off into the forest. \n",
      "The man offered Eddie a bow and five arrows. The bow looked \n",
      "familiar. Somebody Eddie knew made toy bows like this, with the same \n",

      "used the money to get drunk. It must have happened, Eddie thought, \n",

      "but it seemed to be about Hunahpu and Xbalanque. And Kukulcán, \n",
      "Instead of following the hills above the city, they circled around to the \n",
      "west. Eventually they broke out of the forest and crossed the packed-\n",

      "yellows from the temples and the torches had burned low. \n",
      "The city seemed deserted except for two sentries, watching the road \n",

      "The Haawo’ stopped and formed up into a ragged line that stretched \n",
      "all the way across one side of the plaza. They stuck their arrows into \n",
      "the ground between the paving stones, hundreds at a time. The sound \n",
      "was like a hard rain. Most of them had been carrying their bows over \n",

      "At that close range even the crude arrows of the Haawo’ were \n",
      "accurate enough. Some of the Haawo’ jumped up and down with \n",

      "In ten minutes the square was empty except for the dead and  \n",

      "“Eddie?” \n",

      "That didn’t excuse the helicopter. At least the one they’d hijacked \n",
      "from Marsalis had smelled of fresh paint and wd40 inside. Oscar’s was \n",
      "peeling and layered with grime. The armor on the seats was so worn \n",
      "that the fibers showed through. The seat belts were brittle and the \n",
      "weatherstripping was cracked and crumbling. \n",
      "“Pass me that toolbox when I get up, will you?” Oscar said. He \n",
      "climbed on top, right up under the mast that supported the rotors. \n",
      "Carmichael handed him the tools. Oscar had the engine cowling \n",
      "open by the time Faustino got back. He had the fuel pump with him, \n",
      "wrapped in oily rags. \n",
      "Oscar looked it over and nodded and went to work. It took him \n",
      "about ten minutes to get everything put back together. He crawled \n",
      "down, wiped his hands, and then held one black-smeared hand out to \n",
      "Faustino. “I need the key,” he said in Spanish. \n",
      "“Why?” \n",
      "“I have to see if it’s going to run.” \n",
      "Carmichael watched Faustino think it through. He was trying to \n",
      "decide if Oscar was going to make a break for it. Finally he said, “All \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 241\n",
      "right.” He could have unslung his rifle, to make the obvious point, \n",
      "but he didn’t. Carmichael thought that showed a certain amount  \n",
      "of class. \n",
      "Oscar took the key and sat in the right-hand seat. “Get clear,” he \n",
      "shouted, and Faustino and Carmichael backed away. He started flip-\n",
      "ping switches. After a few seconds he cranked the engine and it caught \n",
      "the first time. He let it run, the rotors slowly picking up speed and the \n",
      "turbine climbing in pitch, and then he switched it off again.\n",
      "“Okay?” Faustino shouted. \n",
      "Oscar gave him a thumbs-up, but stayed looking at the instruments for \n",
      "another minute or so. Thinking about his chances, Carmichael figured. \n",
      "Finally Oscar got out and shut the door. Two young rebels came run-\n",
      "ning up with the M60 machine gun from Marsalis’s helicopter. They \n",
      "bolted it to a platform just outside the cargo door while Oscar looked \n",
      "on. He didn’t seem happy about it. \n",
      "“These two compañeros will go with you,” Faustino said in Spanish. \n",
      "“Claro,” Oscar said. \n",
      "“If you try to escape with the helicopter they’ll kill you. They under-\n",
      "stand that they will die when the helicopter crashes. They’re very brave and \n",
      "this doesn’t bother them. You understand what I’m saying to you here?” \n",
      "“Yes,” Oscar said. \n",
      "“Okay,” Faustino said. “Good luck.” He didn’t offer to shake hands. \n",
      "But then, Carmichael thought, Oscar’s hands were still very dirty. \n",
      "Faustino walked away. Carmichael said, “So now there’s soldiers com-\n",
      "ing too.” \n",
      "“Yeah,” Oscar said. “That was the deal.” \n",
      "“I guess I didn’t quite understand. I had the idea we were just going \n",
      "to call in a couple positions and then get out of here.” \n",
      "“Nothing’s that easy.” \n",
      "“So now, even if Carla decides she’s through with you, you still have \n",
      "to come back here and drop those guys off.” \n",
      "“Stay here, then,” Oscar shrugged. “Maybe you’ll be in just the right \n",
      "place when I bring ‘em back and you can catch a ride with me then. But \n",
      "if they get shot up or fall out of the aircraft, then brother, I’m out of here.” \n",
      "They looked at each other for a couple of seconds. He’s scared too, \n",
      "Carmichael realized. The thought didn’t exactly cheer him up. “All \n",
      "right,” Carmichael said. “I’m in.” \n",
      "“Let’s do it,” Oscar said.\n",

      "As they came up over the treetops the land unfolded for Carmichael. \n",
      "In the long rays of the setting sun all the colors were rich and intense. \n",
      "The plain to the west was a solid yellow-green, dotted with darker green \n",
      "clumps of trees. The forest itself was the darkest green of all, streaked \n",
      "with shadows and reaching up into the deep blue of the sky. They \n",
      "climbed to the east, over the silver flash of the river, and then turned \n",
      "south. The crater of El Chichón, twenty miles away, was straight ahead. \n",
      "Carmichael could hear Oscar talking to the rebels. The external \n",
      "channel was turned down to no more than a whisper in Carmichael’s \n",
      "headphones. He had one fierce moment of longing to be away from \n",
      "there, headed home and away from danger. \n",
      "Don’t start, he told himself. Don’t even think about it. \n",
      "The left side cargo door, just behind Carmichael, was locked open so \n",
      "the rebels could get to the machine gun. The inside of the helicopter was \n",
      "like a wind tunnel. When Carmichael looked back, the rebels were lean-\n",
      "ing out the open door like a couple of kids in the back of a pickup truck. \n",
      "Carmichael’s headphones clicked. “I’m going to take us around for a \n",
      "look,” Oscar said in English. “There shouldn’t be any trouble. Not at first, \n",
      "anyway. In this light they won’t be able to tell the difference between us \n",
      "and one of their own. They ain’t gonna shoot their own people.” \n",
      "Carmichael found the footswitch for the intercom. “What do you \n",
      "mean ‘at first’? When is there going to be trouble?” \n",
      "“When we start shooting, I imagine.” \n",
      "“I thought we were just scouts.” \n",
      "“You see those two kids in the back? They used to be in the guardia. \n",
      "They know how to work an M60. They’re not up here just to keep me \n",
      "honest. I thought you understood. The only question is how long they’re \n",
      "going to be able to hold themselves back before they start shooting,” \n",
      "“What happens then?” \n",
      "“We just have to make the best of it, man,” \n",
      "They banked into a long turn toward the west. At first Carmichael \n",
      "tried to lean away as the floor tilted under him. It only seemed to make \n",
      "it worse. He saw Oscar sitting straight up in his seat and made himself \n",
      "do the same. \n",
      "“What about you?” Carmichael asked him. “Thomas said you used to \n",
      "live in Texas. Doesn’t it...I mean, don’t you feel a little weird about this?” \n",
      "“Listen, man, I got nothing against you guys, one to one, you know? \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 243\n",
      "But don’t ask me to feel sorry for those motherfuckers down there. I \n",
      "don’t want them here, they got no business here.” \n",
      "They leveled out over the western plain. The forest here had been \n",
      "slashed and burned for farming years before, and when the soil went \n",
      "dead the farmers moved on. It had grown back as grassland. Given an-\n",
      "other hundred years it would be jungle again. \n",
      "Na Chan was almost directly behind them as they flew into the sun-\n",
      "set. It was hard to see details in the twilight. The first Carmichael saw \n",
      "of Marsalis’s army was a flash off to his right, through Oscar’s window. \n",
      "Oscar banked them around to the north in time for Carmichael to see \n",
      "fire and smoke erupting from the ruins. \n",
      "“Mortars,” Oscar said. “That’s it, then.” He radioed something back \n",
      "to Carla. His voice in the phones sounded like he was a long way away. \n",
      "Another mortar opened up within a hundred yards of the first. \n",
      "Oscar said, “You speak Spanish, right?” \n",
      "“Yeah.” \n",
      "“Those vaqueros back there don’t have no headphones. I need you to \n",
      "go back and tell them not to shoot till I say so. Make them understand. \n",
      "If they start going nuts they’ll get us all killed.” \n",
      "“You mean...just get up and walk back there?” He pictured himself \n",
      "sliding out the open cargo door. \n",
      "“That’s the idea,” Oscar said. “Think you can handle it?” \n",
      "Carmichael took off his headset and hung it up above him. He \n",
      "unbuckled his harness. Oscar looked over at him, the last of the sunset \n",
      "glaring off his mirrorshades. Then he took the glasses off and put them \n",
      "in his pocket. He winked at Carmichael and looked away again. \n",
      "The macho, Carmichael decided, was not just a pose. \n",
      "He stood up, bracing himself on the back of his seat, and stepped \n",
      "carefully over the pedestal control panel between the seats. He found \n",
      "handholds in the exposed framework of the ceiling. It was hard to make \n",
      "his fingers let go so he could move from one to the other. \n",
      "The sun was no more than a line on the horizon. The rush of damp \n",
      "night air brought involuntary tears to his eyes. He leaned over the near-\n",
      "est of the rebels, who was sitting in one of the green canvas passenger \n",
      "seats, taking belts of ammunition out of their boxes. The other man was \n",
      "already facing out, the grips of the machine gun in his hands. \n",
      "“You need to wait,” he shouted at the nearer man. “You guys \n",
      "shouldn’t shoot yet, okay? Not till Oscar says it’s okay.” \n",
      "244 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Okay,” the man said. He was so thin his hollow chest seemed to \n",
      "pull his shoulders down into a slump. He wore a dirty white T-shirt \n",
      "and jeans and running shoes. He was trying to grow a mustache and \n",
      "not getting very far. He didn’t seem to be paying attention to Carmi-\n",
      "chael at all. \n",
      "“It’s very important,” Carmichael said. “They don’t know who we are \n",
      "yet, understand? So we have to keep it like that.” \n",
      "“Sí,” the man said. He passed a belt of ammo to the gunner, who \n",
      "poked and prodded it into the open gate of the gun with little slaps of \n",
      "his fingers. \n",
      "“You need to tell him, okay?” \n",
      "Finally the man turned to the gunner and passed the message along. \n",
      "At least he seemed to. The wind tore most of his words away. The gun-\n",
      "ner looked at Carmichael and then back at the other rebel and nodded. \n",
      "Carmichael could feel their disdain. He wanted to be back in his seat \n",
      "but he didn’t want the rebels to see him being afraid. So he stood there, \n",
      "hanging on and looking out to where the dark blue of the sky met the \n",
      "blackness of the land. The moon was already up, a little better than half \n",
      "full. There were more flashes from the mortars. He couldn’t hear them \n",
      "over the roar of the air from the open door. \n",
      "Oscar looked over his shoulder and shouted, “Okay back there?”\n",
      "Carmichael nodded and made his way up to the front. He stood \n",
      "behind the seats, one hand on each. Oscar reached up with his left hand \n",
      "and pulled the headphones down around his neck. “I’m going to take us \n",
      "in over the mortars,” he shouted. “Just for a look-see. Tell your boys to \n",
      "pay attention, but no shooting. Next time it’ll be for real.” \n",
      "“I don’t know the word for mortar,” Carmichael said. \n",
      "“Mortero.”\n",
      "He took the message back to them. Walking was a little easier this \n",
      "time. The gunner had the ammo belt locked into his weapon and \n",
      "was tracking the barrel through figure eights, puffing out his cheeks \n",
      "with sound effects Carmichael couldn’t hear. He looked up when \n",
      "Carmichael finished shouting at him. \n",
      "“No voy a tirar,” he said. I’m not going to shoot. He smiled. His face \n",
      "was very round, the eyes close together, his sideburns extending out into \n",
      "his cheeks from the bottoms of his ears. \n",
      "Carmichael sat down next to the thin one. “What do they call you?” \n",
      "Carmichael asked him. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 245\n",
      "“El Hambre.” The Hunger. The name suited him. \n",
      "“John,” Carmichael said, pointing to himself. “And the man with \n",
      "the gun?” \n",
      "“He calls himself Cantinflas,” El Hambre said, clearly disappointed \n",
      "that anybody would name themselves after a comedian when there was \n",
      "a serious revolution to be fought. \n",
      "They had circled all the way around and were coming in over the \n",
      "mortar emplacements from the north. Carmichael sat up on the edge of \n",
      "his seat. He saw twenty or so US soldiers lying prone in the high grass. \n",
      "There were two mortars. The rest of them had the bullpup infantry \n",
      "rifles. Carmichael couldn’t see if any of the rifles were set up to launch \n",
      "grenades. He tried not to think about what a grenade would do to the \n",
      "inside of the helicopter. \n",
      "The men were looking up, and a couple of them waved. Carmichael \n",
      "started to wave back and then pulled his arm down. On the next pass \n",
      "the kid with the joke name would be opening up on them with an \n",
      "M60 machine gun. \n",
      "Carmichael’s nerve broke. He got up and started for the front of the \n",
      "ship. He was cold and sweating at the same time and his bladder burned \n",
      "with the need to piss away his fear. “Listen,” he said to Oscar. \n",
      "Oscar had his headset on again and didn’t hear him. He looked up \n",
      "and said, “We’re turning around. Tell them to get the mortars. The mor-\n",
      "tars first, understand?” \n",
      "“I—” Carmichael said. The floor tilted under him and the helicopter \n",
      "came around. He staggered, reset his feet. \n",
      "“This is it,” Oscar said. “Get ready.” \n",
      "Carmichael didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t think. He walked \n",
      "back to the rear of the helicopter. It seemed to take forever and still it \n",
      "was over too soon. He told Cantinflas to take out the mortars first. El \n",
      "Hambre opened more ammo boxes and laid the belts out flat on the \n",
      "floor. Carmichael stood a couple of feet back from the open doorway, \n",
      "watching with sick dread. \n",
      "Ten years from now, he thought, what am I going to wish I’d done? \n",
      "If I’m alive ten years from now, he told himself, I’m not going to care. \n",
      "They came in lower this time and Cantinflas opened up with the \n",
      "M60. The orange tracers seemed huge in the darkness and the first burst \n",
      "arced into the dirt a hundred yards away from the mortars. Cantinflas \n",
      "let out some kind of war cry and stood up in the doorway, jerking the \n",
      "246 lewis shiner\n",
      "handles of the gun around and firing again. Carmichael saw bodies \n",
      "twitch like puppets as the bullets tore into them. \n",
      "He closed his eyes. He remembered lying in the leaves and dirt while \n",
      "the government planes roared overhead, knowing he was going to die. \n",
      "No, he thought. Wrong image. It put him too close to the men on the \n",
      "ground. Think about Marsalis, he told himself. Think about Rich, his \n",
      "cia pal. Think of the way they squeezed what they wanted out of you \n",
      "and threw you away. \n",
      "It didn’t help. He was starting to shake. It wasn’t fear, or at least not \n",
      "fear alone. It was an overwhelming sense of wrongness. He climbed \n",
      "back to the front of the helicopter, hand over hand. The rotors sucked \n",
      "the cordite from the machine gun into the cabin, choking him. He \n",
      "crawled into the left-hand seat and strapped himself in. He put on the \n",
      "headset to help block the sound of the gun. \n",
      "Oscar’s voice came over the intercom. “You all right?” \n",
      "“Yeah.”\n",
      "There was a new sound now, a smaller sound, a ticking, like gravel \n",
      "hitting a windshield. Suddenly Oscar grabbed the lever next to his left \n",
      "hand, pulling and twisting it in the same motion, and they shot up into \n",
      "the air. Then the nose of the helicopter went down and Carmichael felt \n",
      "a rush of vertigo. \n",
      "“What was that?” Carmichael asked. “That ticking sound?” \n",
      "Oscar looked at him like he was an idiot. “As the vets up at Bell used \n",
      "to say...we’re taking some hits, old buddy.” \n",
      "“Jesus Christ,” Carmichael whispered. \n",
      "“Those little bullets don’t look like much,” Oscar said, “but they got a \n",
      "hell of a muzzle velocity.” \n",
      "The noise had stopped. Carmichael hoped it was because they were \n",
      "out of range. “Do we go back to the camp now, or what?” he asked. \n",
      "“Somehow,” Oscar said, “I get the feeling your heart isn’t in this.” \n",
      "“I’m a feature writer,” Carmichael said. “I got no business here.”\n",
      "“You mean you interview rock stars, and shit like that?” \n",
      "“That was supposed to be the idea.” \n",
      "“You know Linda Ronstadt?” \n",
      "“Only the big shots get the Linda Ronstadt interviews. That’s why \n",
      "I’m down here. This whole story—Carla, Marsalis, the cia—that’s my \n",
      "ticket to the big time. To get to where they’ll let me interview some-\n",
      "body like Ronstadt. Or Dylan, or whoever.” \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 247\n",
      "“Good luck.” \n",
      "“Yeah. Thanks. Just get me out of this alive, okay? I can handle the rest.” \n",
      "A white-hot flare sizzled into life a few hundred feet away. \n",
      "Carmichael was blinded for a second. When he could see again the \n",
      "jungle looked like a model train layout, the trees pale and spindly, their \n",
      "shadows wobbling as the flare drifted down toward them. \n",
      "Two more mortars opened up from the north side of the ruins. \n",
      "Ground troops were running across the plain now, heads down, rifles \n",
      "held out in front of them. Something moved in Carmichael’s peripheral \n",
      "vision and he turned his head to the left. \n",
      "There was a helicopter coming up on them fast out of the east. \n",
      "“Oscar, there’s—” \n",
      "He let his foot off the intercom switch and Oscar’s voice cut in, \n",
      "“—see it.” \n",
      "The machine gun opened up in the back. Carmichael’s hands tight-\n",
      "ened on the armrest of his seat. Oscar yanked the controls and sud-\n",
      "denly they were in free fall. Carmichael’s heart lurched and his stomach \n",
      "tried to crawl out of his mouth. It didn’t help when he told himself \n",
      "that Oscar knew what he was doing. It was a cellular panic, beyond his \n",
      "conscious control. \n",
      "He could see Oscar’s feet pumping on the rudder pedals, making \n",
      "the tail of the helicopter wag like a dog’s. The turbine howled with a \n",
      "tortured metal sound and a light flashed amber on the pedestal control \n",
      "panel. In his mind Carmichael could see the helicopter shaking itself to \n",
      "pieces, see himself flying through the air, arms over his head, his clothes \n",
      "billowing out around him. \n",
      "The ground rushed up at them in the harsh light of the flare. Marsalis’s \n",
      "soldiers were swarming like insects, seemed to be crawling right out of \n",
      "the earth. Sometimes there was a burst of flame from one of their rifles. \n",
      "Sometimes one of them fell down from invisible enemy fire. There didn’t \n",
      "seem to be any pattern to the fighting, just frenzied individuals and \n",
      "random death and dismemberment. Then Oscar swung around and they \n",
      "were climbing again. The M60 rattled steadily behind them. \n",
      "And then the other helicopter was back. \n",
      "It came up fast, again from the left. They were going after Cantinflas, \n",
      "Carmichael realized. He could hear the pounding of the other engine, \n",
      "even over the noise of the machine gun and their own machine. His \n",
      "heart seemed to be trying to keep time with it. There were frantic \n",
      "248 lewis shiner\n",
      "voices in Carmichael’s headphones, speaking English, but not loud \n",
      "enough for him to make sense of them. \n",
      "The other copter had four machine guns, two on each side, operated \n",
      "from the cockpit. Carmichael watched the barrels come to life, twitch-\n",
      "ing and spitting tracers. The tracers seemed to sail toward him with im-\n",
      "possible slowness. He stomped on the floor switch, yelling Oscar’s name \n",
      "into the intercom. \n",
      "Oscar swung the stick to the right and forward. Carmichael’s vision \n",
      "tunneled and he tasted bile at the back of his throat. The cockpit was \n",
      "suddenly suffocating him, despite the buffeting wind. His head throbbed \n",
      "and his chest felt hot and tight. The other helicopter danced and blurred \n",
      "in the frame of his window. \n",
      "And then, finally, Cantinflas was shooting back. \n",
      "Carmichael felt like he was reaching out physically with the stream \n",
      "of bullets. Despair washed over him as they missed, as if it was his own \n",
      "body falling uselessly into the void. And then another volley spun out \n",
      "and he felt himself rising up in his seat, whispering “please, please.” And \n",
      "then he felt the glowing orange pieces of himself cross the front of the \n",
      "helicopter, felt the release as the enemy windshield exploded under him, \n",
      "felt all-consuming joy as the rotor tilted and the US helicopter dove \n",
      "headlong for the ground. \n",
      "He fell back into his seat, exhausted, trembling all over. For three or \n",
      "four seconds he had glimpsed a different existence, an existence without \n",
      "questions. The lives of the men in the other helicopter, his countrymen, \n",
      "had not mattered. Truth and justice were irrelevant. Carmichael’s life \n",
      "had been on the line and he had won. \n",
      "He saw then what had always escaped him before: how people could \n",
      "go to war, could physically carry out the act. It was like a different order \n",
      "of consciousness. It had been intense and primal and he knew already \n",
      "that it had changed him. It had been a surrender as intense as sex, as \n",
      "powerful as drugs, and just as much a denial of self. He had become his \n",
      "hatred and he had seen his hatred take effect. \n",
      "They were back over the ruins now. Oscar waved his left fist in the \n",
      "air and shouted in triumph. In the trenches below, Carmichael saw the \n",
      "muzzle flashes of the rebel fals, a continuous sparkling, like a line of \n",
      "Christmas tree lights. West of the trenches was no man’s land, an empty \n",

      "They never had a chance. \n",

      "Huey smashed flat from the sides. Before Carmichael had a moment to \n",
      "be really afraid, it was over. \n",
      "The Plexiglas windscreen spiderwebbed and something thudded into \n",
      "the roof. Oscar jerked back in obvious pain. There was a crunch and the \n",

      "pedestal flashed and an alarm hooted. \n",
      "Carmichael looked at Oscar. He was still moving. His right hand was \n",

      "to his seat all the way down. \n",
      "They were gliding smoothly, not plummeting the way Carmichael \n",
      "had thought they would be. “Don’t touch anything,” Oscar said in the \n",

      "Carmichael knew the word. It meant the rotors were turning from the \n",

      "the helicopter came up. At the last moment he jerked up with his left \n",

      "to stop on the grassy plain. Oscar slumped back in his seat and closed \n",
      "his eyes. \n",
      "Carmichael got out of his harness and crawled over to look at Oscar. \n",
      "There was a dark stain around his collarbone on the left side. His color \n",

      "center, from his waist to his right shoulder. He staggered for another \n",
      "couple of steps and fell in the grass, twitching. \n",
      "The hull was ticking again from Northamerican bullets. Carmichael \n",
      "fought with Oscar’s harness. The seat began to move under him and he \n",
      "looked up to see Cantinflas doing something to the frame that held it \n",
      "up. Then the entire seat tilted straight back and Cantinflas pulled Oscar \n",
      "out onto the cabin floor. \n",
      "“Can you get him?” Cantinflas said. \n",
      "“Creo que sí,” Carmichael said. \n",
      "“Good. Then I’ll get the machine gun.” \n",
      "Carmichael got out of the helicopter. The deck was a few inches \n",
      "higher than his knees. He leaned in and grabbed Oscar by the collar and \n",
      "dragged him to the edge of the door. His legs felt cold where they were \n",
      "exposed below the body of the machine. He danced nervously from \n",
      "one foot to the other. \n",

      "“Come on, come on,” he said. He turned Oscar onto his stomach and \n",
      "kept pulling. It got easier as Oscar’s blood began to wet the floor. \n",
      "Overhead the flare sputtered out and everything went dark. Oscar \n",
      "made a whining noise that faded in and out, like part of it was going \n",
      "too high for human hearing. Carmichael knelt and pulled Oscar into a \n",
      "clumsy fireman’s carry, his shoulder jutting into Oscar’s stomach. \n",
      "He sprinted for the trench. \n",
      "He knew they were shooting at him. He was moving so slowly. He \n",
      "had plenty of time to see El Hambre getting hit and going down, over \n",
      "and over in his mind. \n",
      "Finally the trench was there. Carmichael jumped in. The extra weight \n",
      "made him hit hard, going to his knees, and Oscar slipped down into his \n",
      "arms. The bottom of the trench was still muddy from the rain that after-\n",
      "noon. Carmichael eased Oscar’s dead weight down into the mud. \n",
      "There was a sharp explosion up in the sky. Carmichael looked up and \n",
      "saw flames coming out of the Cobra. The rebels had hit it with some-\n",
      "thing. “Gotcha, you son of a bitch,” Carmichael whispered. The Cobra \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 251\n",
      "wheeled off, trailing smoke. He waited for it to blow up, but it didn’t \n",
      "happen. That was okay. That made two of their helicopters down, not \n",
      "to mention the one that Thomas had stolen. They only had one left and \n",
      "they’d have to be cautious with it. \n",
      "Another flare went off. A harsh shadow appeared on the back wall \n",
      "of the trench, moving up and down ever so slightly. That and leftover \n",
      "airsickness made Carmichael think seriously for a while about throwing \n",
      "up. It took him a minute or two to fight it down. \n",
      "His perceptions were sharp and clear, but his brain couldn’t seem to \n",
      "make anything out of them. The dirt around Carmichael was burned \n",
      "black in a jagged pattern, like a child’s drawing of the sun. Grenade, \n",
      "Carmichael thought. The mud under his feet was red with blood. He \n",
      "saw an arm, stiff and shiny as a mannequin’s. The stump was blackened \n",
      "gristle, the kind of flaky carbon that came off the bottom of an oven. \n",
      "He looked in the other direction and saw somebody crawling toward \n",
      "him. The face was painted in shades of blood and dirt, one eye closed \n",
      "and clogged with mud. Carmichael couldn’t see if the man’s legs were \n",
      "still there or not. He didn’t want to know. The man was starting to crawl \n",
      "over Oscar and Carmichael had to push him away. \n",
      "“Cálmese,” Carmichael said. “Be cool, now.” He tugged Oscar out \n",
      "from under the crawling man and got him sitting up against one wall. A \n",
      "mortar shell hit a dozen yards away and Carmichael grabbed his knees \n",
      "and ducked. Chunks of dirt and limestone pounded down on him.\n",
      "Something was burning his hand. He opened his eyes and saw a jag-\n",
      "ged piece of metal, shaped like a tiny lightning bolt, lying on the web of \n",
      "his right thumb. Shrapnel, still hot from the explosion. He shook it off \n",
      "and sucked the burn until the first bright pain of it went away. \n",
      "The crawling man lay with his face in the mud. Carmichael rolled him \n",
      "onto his side, brushing the dirt away from his mouth. He gasped when \n",
      "Carmichael moved him and that seemed to start him breathing again. \n",
      "I can’t take this, Carmichael thought. \n",
      "He crawled out the back side of the trench, got Oscar under the arms, \n",
      "and dragged him up out of the hole. He smelled burned meat, then a \n",
      "second later realized why. That’s all any of us are, he thought. Meat. \n",
      "He got Oscar over his shoulder and ran for the cover of the forest. \n",
      "Something tripped him up a few feet away from the first of the trees. \n",
      "He went down on all fours, Oscar’s head thudding into the dirt. He got \n",
      "up again and kept running. Something was wrong with his right foot. \n",
      "252 lewis shiner\n",
      "He ran until he couldn’t hear bullets hitting around him anymore. Then \n",
      "he put Oscar down and turned his foot up to look at it. \n",
      "A bullet had knocked the heel off his hiking boot. The foot under-\n",
      "neath was tender and probably bruised, but the skin wasn’t even broken. \n",
      "It seemed like a joke. Carmichael was afraid if he started laughing he \n",
      "wouldn’t be able to stop.\n",
      "There were limestone blocks the size of end tables on all sides, \n",
      "but nothing big enough to hide behind. He would have to keep mov-\n",
      "ing. For the moment Carmichael couldn’t seem to get up. The leaves \n",
      "overhead turned the light of the flare to an aquarium green. It was a \n",
      "peaceful light and he leaned back against one of the limestone blocks \n",
      "and got his breath. \n",
      "The rebels must have pulled back from the trenches. Only the crawl-\n",
      "ing man and the dead were left there. In any case Carla was losing. The \n",
      "helicopter Thomas stole from Marsalis was still in the clearing. With a \n",
      "little luck it hadn’t been hurt. The rebels were in no position to stop \n",
      "him. They were taking too much of a beating. He and Thomas could \n",
      "get out of there, with as many of the other civilians as they could carry. \n",
      "It was a happy enough thought to get him back on his feet. Just ahead \n",
      "the path curved around a low hill. On top of it was a three-foot-high \n",
      "wall, the beginning of a restored temple. The big pyramid, and the \n",
      "helicopter, would be in that direction. He hoisted Oscar and took two \n",
      "steps and then saw a gun barrel gleaming in the eerie green light. He \n",
      "stopped and braced his legs, balancing Oscar with one arm and holding \n",
      "the other over his head. “Don’t shoot!” he called out in Spanish. “Carla \n",
      "knows me, okay? Don’t for God’s sake shoot me now!” \n",
      "A second later a round face looked over the wall. Cantinflas. He was \n",
      "grinning. “John! Hello, John!” he said in English. He held up the M60 \n",
      "with one hand and an ammo belt with the other. Very brave, Faustino \n",
      "had said. His death would not bother him. \n",
      "Carmichael didn’t know whether to feel sorry for him or not. He \n",
      "put his hands down and started moving again. He fell into a shambling \n",
      "trot, limping on his bruised right foot. The mortar shells were really \n",
      "coming down now. The path curved back in the opposite direction and \n",
      "Carmichael came out of the trees into the central square. There was a \n",
      "long, low temple in front of him with some kind of tower coming out \n",
      "of the middle. Beyond it was the helicopter and the big pyramid. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 253\n",
      "He ran for the shelter of the temple. It was farther than it had looked. \n",
      "His foot hurt and his lungs wouldn’t inflate. Oscar weighed a thousand \n",
      "pounds. He made the last few yards on sheer willpower. He leaned Os-\n",
      "car against the wall of the temple and lay face down in the dirt. \n",
      "The ground shook from mortar shells. The gunfire built up to cli-\n",
      "maxes that ended with mortar explosions, a rhythm like ocean waves \n",
      "crashing on the rocks. Carmichael wanted, unbelievably, to go to sleep, \n",
      "right there in the middle of the noise and smoke and death. \n",
      "He stared across the clearing. He could see the two Mayan huts at the \n",
      "base of the pyramid. One of them was burning. The ground between \n",
      "Carmichael and the pyramid was cratered, smoky, desolate as the moon. \n",
      "There were rebel tents on all sides of him that were collapsed or shred-\n",
      "ded or burnt. \n",
      "There was somebody moving in the undamaged Mayan hut. Thomas, \n",
      "he hoped. He waved one hand, but the only answer he got was another \n",
      "mortar shell. He crawled over to the temple wall and lay there as they \n",
      "fell, over and over. It was relentless, spiteful, crazed. They were blasting \n",
      "the city into gravel. \n",
      "He tried to count the seconds between explosions. He couldn’t \n",
      "concentrate enough to manage it. They were going off every time he \n",
      "breathed and for a few panicked instants it seemed like the two things \n",
      "were connected. He tried to hold his breath. There was no air in his \n",
      "lungs for him to hold. \n",
      "When it finally stopped it took him a long time to realize it. He’d \n",
      "pulled back into a part of himself that touched the outside world as \n",
      "little as possible. \n",
      "His eyes were open. There was a tree in front of him, and his back \n",
      "was against the temple wall. His right leg made a small whispering noise \n",
      "as it moved in the dirt, kicking out in a slow, unconscious reflex. There \n",
      "was no other sound. No mortars, no gunfire, no insects, no helicopters. \n",
      "He stood up. He had to grab for the tree as his legs tried to fold \n",
      "under him. No good, he told them. He staggered over to Oscar and felt \n",
      "the man’s neck for a pulse. \n",
      "There wasn’t one. \n",
      "“No,” he said. \n",
      "He tried the wrist, held his palm against Oscar’s nose to feel the air \n",
      "move as he breathed. Nothing. \n",
      "He ripped Oscar’s shirt off. A dark purple bruise covered his stomach \n",
      "254 lewis shiner\n",
      "and chest. Internal bleeding. No doubt made worse by being slung over \n",
      "Carmichael’s back. \n",
      "“Goddammit!” Carmichael shouted. “It’s not fair!” He’d nearly killed \n",
      "himself to save the son of a bitch’s life and now the son of a bitch was \n",
      "dead anyway. What was the fucking point? \n",
      "He slapped Oscar across the face. “Goddamn you!” he screamed. He \n",
      "swung again and missed and fell on his knees in the dirt. “Goddamn \n",
      "you!” he said. “Goddamn you!” \n",
      "And then there was a new noise. Voices. Not a human sound, but \n",
      "human voices making it. The voices of Marsalis’s soldiers, making their \n",
      "final charge. It was high and hollow, a hundred wolf howls, the notes \n",
      "beating against each other like reverberating feedback. \n",
      "It was the most terrifying thing Carmichael had ever heard. It sound-\n",
      "ed like a single mythic monster, screaming for his blood. He backed \n",
      "away from Oscar’s body, still on his knees, and slowly turned around. He \n",
      "heard Cantinflas’ machine gun start up. Against the howling voices it \n",
      "was a thin and hopeless sound. \n",
      "He could hear their footsteps now. They literally shook the earth. The \n",
      "pounding seemed to come from all around him, shaking dirt and rocks \n",
      "loose from the temple and bringing them down around Carmichael’s \n",
      "head and shoulders. \n",
      "And then he realized. It wasn’t just the soldiers. \n",
      "The tree in front of him split in half with a sound like thunder, \n",
      "showering him with splinters. The ground humped up in front of him \n",
      "and knocked him over. He got up again and started running toward the \n",
      "pyramid, toward the helicopter, knowing he was too late. \n",
      "Not just the soldiers. The earth itself. The earth itself was rising up \n",
      "against them.\n",

      "and glittering, like some kind of gemstone. There was too much to \n",
      "take in but he tried to absorb what he could. There had been some kind \n",
      "of battle and now it was over. There were bodies in the central courtyard, \n",
      "flames rising up out of the Palace and the Temple of the Inscriptions. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 255\n",
      "Eddie was standing on the steps of the Palace. \n",
      "It didn’t look quite like Eddie; his skin was redder, his nose longer \n",
      "and his forehead flatter. But Thomas knew it was Eddie just the same. \n",
      "He climbed the steps toward him. “Eddie?” he said. “Eddie, is that you?” \n",
      "“Kukulcán,” Eddie said. “My name is Kukulcán.” He was speaking \n",
      "Mayan with an accent Thomas had never heard before. \n",
      "“Eddie,” Thomas said. “You’re freaking, man. Come on, snap out of \n",
      "it.” He stopped on the step below Eddie’s and reached out one hand. \n",
      "Eddie grabbed his wrist and pushed him back. \n",
      "“Go away,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“What’s this shit around your eyes?” Thomas said. It looked like he’d \n",

      "Christ’s sake.” \n",
      "“English,” Eddie said. \n",
      "“Attaboy. Me Thomas, you Eddie, okay?”\n",
      "“Thomas?” \n",
      "“Your brother.” \n",
      "“Yes,” Eddie said, in halting English. “I think I know you. What are \n",

      "“Same as you. Chan Ma’ax gave me a piece of mushroom, told me to \n",
      "come and get you.” \n",
      "“Get me?” Eddie said. \n",
      "Thomas was feeling a little nervous. The night was oddly bright from \n",
      "the flames and the flickering made everything look like it was just a \n",
      "projection and not solid at all. He turned around and looked at the dead \n",
      "men on the steps. \n",
      "“It’s happening right now, isn’t it?” he said. “The collapse. Right in \n",
      "front of me. I’m actually standing here, watching the collapse of Classic \n",
      "Mayan civilization.” \n",
      "“It was the kids that did it,” Eddie said. “They got tired of war. Tired \n",
      "of priests and nobles getting rich while the peasants starved and died \n",
      "for them.” \n",
      "“Like the sixties,” Thomas said. “Kids against the world.” He picked \n",
      "up an arrow from the steps. “Amazing,” he said. “I always wondered if \n",
      "they could have had these.” \n",
      "“Chan Ma’ax gave them to the Haawo’. To the rebels.” \n",
      "“Chan Ma’ax?” Thomas said. “He’s here?” He shook his head. “Of \n",
      "course he’s here. He’s been taking the mushroom for years.” \n",
      "256 lewis shiner\n",
      "“He’s bringing on xu’tan. The end of the world. It starts here. It ends \n",

      "a bitch I’ve ever known. Sometimes I can’t believe you’re my brother.” \n",
      "“You came to get me,” Eddie said. “That’s really an amazing thing for \n",
      "you to do. I didn’t think...I didn’t think you’d do something like that  \n",
      "for me.” \n",
      "“Yeah, well,” Thomas said. “I’m here, aren’t I?”\n",
      "“It’s like I don’t even know you anymore. We never...never even \n",
      " really got a chance to talk. I don’t know who you are now, what you’ve \n",

      "“I’ve been in Cuernavaca the last two years,” Thomas told him. \n",
      "“There was this project there doing all kinds of appropriate technolo-\n",

      "that kind of stuff.” \n",
      "Eddie nodded. “That’s good, Thomas. That’s really good.” \n",
      "“It was starting to be. What really sucks is, I had finally made up my \n",
      "258 lewis shiner\n",
      "mind to stick it out there. You know, really committed to something. \n",
      "For like the first time in my entire life. And then the revolution came \n",
      "along and took it away.” \n",
      "“It’s a good thing to do,” Eddie said. “Whether you do it there or \n",
      "someplace else.” \n",
      "“I guess so,” Thomas said. “With what I know now I could go back to \n",
      "Austin, where I know they’ve got money for it. Set one up there, maybe \n",
      "take it overseas if the world ever settles down.” \n",
      "“Sure,” Eddie said. \n",
      "Thomas felt a sudden surge of warmth. He put one arm around Ed-\n",

      "“Can you remember anything?” Thomas asked. “Do you remember \n",
      "the ruins? Carla? Oscar?” He waited a second and then said, “Lindsey?” \n",
      "The last name made Eddie flinch. “Those are Eddie’s memories.” \n",

      "Thomas sat up, blinking. His vision was blurred again. He walked \n",
      "across the stone room and got his glasses out of his clothes. \n",
      "He remembered coming out of the forest with Eddie, the trees spar-\n",
      "kling and dancing like they were under a strobe light, flickering too fast \n",
      "for the eye to follow. They had climbed the pyramid and gone back into \n",
      "the stone room where, for a second, Thomas had been afraid they would \n",
      "find their bodies still lying there, tripped out on the mushroom. But the \n",
      "room had been empty. \n",
      "He remembered sitting down to catch his breath. Eddie had put a \n",
      "robe on over his loincloth and stretched out next to him. Now Thomas \n",
      "didn’t know if it had really happened or if he’d dreamed it. \n",
      "He was still in his Mayan robe. He didn’t remember putting it on, but \n",
      "he must have. There were his clothes, piled neatly in the corner. He got \n",
      "dressed. Eddie had fallen asleep again. \n",
      "Or, Thomas thought, it never really happened. And he’s still in his coma. \n",
      "He knelt next to Eddie and touched his shoulder. Eddie opened his \n",
      "eyes. “Thomas,” Eddie said. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 259\n",
      "“Yeah,” Thomas said. “Listen, do you remember what just happened? \n",
      "Me coming to get you and everything?” \n",
      "“Happened?” Eddie said. He was in a bad way. He looked like the \n",
      "Wild Man of Borneo. The war had started outside and that wasn’t help-\n",
      "ing. Eddie winced painfully at every sound. Thomas didn’t feel that bad \n",
      "himself. A little hollow and shaky, like he’d been up all night, but he was \n",
      "so charged with energy that it hardly mattered. \n",
      "“Do you know what I’m talking about?” Thomas said. “Can you even \n",
      "understand what I’m saying to you?” Eddie just shook his head. \n",
      "Thomas grabbed him under one arm and led him outside. The he-\n",
      "licopter was still there, at least, and looked okay. Most of the shells had \n",
      "been hitting north and east, toward the Palace, though one had caught \n",
      "the ramada where he and Lindsey had slept. It had collapsed and the \n",
      "damp thatch was smoldering. There were lights in the godhouse next to \n",
      "it and Thomas heard the squawk of a radio. It could have been Oscar’s \n",
      "voice; Thomas wasn’t sure. \n",
      "It did him good to see Lindsey’s face when he walked in with Ed-\n",
      "die. She was sitting in a corner with Chan Zapata and she looked up \n",
      "and saw them standing in the doorway. Her mouth came open and she \n",
      "couldn’t finish what she’d been about to say. \n",
      "“Hi,” Thomas said. He had his arm around Eddie’s waist. Eddie was \n",
      "conscious, but very weak. He stared at Chan Ma’ax and Chan Ma’ax \n",
      "looked back and nodded. The rest of the Mayans, Nuxi’ and Ma’ax \n",
      "Garcia and the rest, didn’t seem to care. They all sat against the walls \n",
      "with their knees up and stared into empty space. \n",
      "“My God,” Lindsey said. “I saw you take it. I saw you put it in your \n",
      "mouth and chew it up and swallow it.” \n",
      "“I took it,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Didn’t it...didn’t it do anything?” \n",
      "“It did everything,” Thomas said. “It was like Eddie said. I saw Na \n",
      "Chan at the end of the Classic period. It was as real as...anything. I \n",
      "found Eddie, like Chan Ma’ax told me to. I brought him back.” He \n",
      "glanced away. “I don’t know. That’s what it felt like. But Eddie’s too far \n",
      "gone to tell me if it happened for him the same as it did for me.” \n",
      "Lindsey stood up. She would go to Eddie first, Thomas thought. But \n",
      "instead she came up close to him and stood there with her arms crossed. \n",
      "“You seem different somehow,” she said. \n",
      "“It’s not exactly normal around here.” Her hair was stiff and \n",
      "260 lewis shiner\n",
      "clumped together, and there were bruise-colored crescents under her \n",
      "eyes. She smelled like sweat and smoke. There were streaks of dirt on \n",
      "her neck. Thomas wanted to put his arms around her and hold her as \n",
      "close as he could. He brought up the image of her and Eddie together, \n",
      "by the river, Lindsey’s head thrashing from side to side. It helped him \n",
      "keep his distance. \n",
      "“And Eddie’s back,” she said. “I can’t believe it.” \n",
      "“Don’t,” Thomas said. “He’s completely batshit. But he’s able to walk \n",
      "around. That alone seems pretty miraculous. Maybe he’ll get better.” \n",
      "“But you don’t think he will.”\n",
      "“No.” \n",
      "“Why didn’t it hurt you?” \n",
      "“I don’t know. Maybe Eddie and I have got some enzyme that pro-\n",
      "tects us, and I’ve got more of it than he does. Maybe it’s some great \n",
      "mystical thing, like Chan Ma’ax was saying. But then it doesn’t really \n",
      "make any difference. Have you looked outside lately?” \n",
      "Lindsey shuddered. “Yes.” \n",
      "“I mean at the helicopter. There’s nobody left to guard it. You and me \n",
      "and Eddie could try to get out of here.” \n",
      "“Are you up to it? I mean, after taking the mushroom and every-\n",
      "thing?” She touched his cheek with the ends of her fingers. “Do you \n",
      "think you could fly it?” \n",
      "He pushed her hand away. “I’m fine,” he said, knowing he was over-\n",
      "reacting. She’d just touched him, that was all. She hadn’t meant anything \n",
      "by it. “I’m taking Eddie down there and I’m going to see what I can do. \n",
      "Once you hear the rotors start turning, you’ve got a couple of minutes \n",
      "to make up your mind. If I can get it to that point, where the machine’s \n",
      "actually started up, then I’m leaving. You can either stay here or come \n",
      "with us. Whatever you want.” \n",
      "He could see the words hurting her. He told himself he didn’t care. \n",
      "“No,” she said. “I want to come.” \n",
      "Eddie hadn’t been paying any attention to the conversation. Now he \n",
      "worked himself free from Thomas’s arm and went to crouch by Chan \n",
      "Zapata. Thomas followed along, in case he decided to pass out. \n",
      "“—the reason your father didn’t want you to come here,” Eddie was \n",
      "saying in Mayan. “He was trying to save you. He didn’t want you to be-\n",
      "come xiw. You know what that is? That’s what happened to me. It changes \n",
      "you too much. Once you start, you’re no good for anything else.” \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 261\n",
      "“Better that than to be nothing,” Chan Zapata said. \n",
      "“You are more than you think. You will be the next t’o’ohil. The last \n",
      "one. It’s very important. The new world will have to remember what \n",
      "went on before. You have to remember for them. You understand?” \n",
      "“C’mon, Eddie,” Thomas said. “Chan Zapata, I’m going to try to \n",
      "get us out of here. Round up everybody who wants to try it with me. \n",
      "When you hear the helicopter start up, bring them down. Okay?” \n",
      "Chan Zapata looked at his father. “I don’t know if they will come.” \n",
      "“Yeah,” Thomas said. “I kind of figured it would be like that. Do what \n",
      "you can.” \n",
      "He grabbed Eddie and steered him toward the door.\n",
      "He stashed Eddie in the shadows at the bottom of the pyramid \n",
      "and sprinted for the helicopter. The Northamericans had put up a flare, \n",
      "lighting the place up like a stage. He crawled in the copilot door and \n",
      "bent low over the seat. The flare sputtered out and the world went dark. \n",
      "He reached over to the right side of the pedestal and felt along the edge. \n",
      "The key was gone. \n",
      "“Shit,” Thomas whispered. If Ramos had it, he’d never get it back. He \n",
      "didn’t even know where they’d taken Ramos off to. \n",
      "He crawled back out of the helicopter and inched around to where \n",
      "he could see into the godhouse. Faustino sat at the radio. He had his cap \n",
      "off and he kept running his hands through what little hair he had left. \n",
      "Carla sat a few feet away. She had her crutch by her left hand and a rifle \n",
      "by her right. She looked like she’d been crying. \n",
      "The rest of the noncombatants were huddled in the godhouse with \n",
      "them. There were two middle-aged women and a dozen children under \n",
      "the age of eight or nine. The older ones, Thomas assumed, were out \n",
      "fighting somewhere, or running messages. Or dead. \n",
      "The women and kids were bandaging the wounded that had already \n",
      "straggled back from the lines. They had three soldiers laid out on mats. \n",
      "One of them must have been burned in an explosion; his entire face \n",
      "and the left side of his body were purple. Another one kept trying to \n",
      "sit up and watch while they worked on a hole in his stomach. He was \n",
      "making high groaning noises that turned up at the end, like questions. \n",
      "One of the women kept pulling him down by the shoulders. \n",
      "Two of the camp’s mongrel dogs paced back and forth around the \n",
      "perimeter of the open hut, whining at every new explosion or rattle \n",
      "262 lewis shiner\n",
      "of gunfire. One of them stopped and looked toward the helicopter \n",
      "and barked. \n",
      "What the hell, Thomas thought. He stepped out into the open. Then \n",
      "he saw that the dog was actually barking at Eddie, who’d wandered over \n",
      "from the pyramid. Eddie took something down that had been hang-\n",
      "ing from the rafters of the hut. It was a bird, Thomas realized, a quetzal. \n",
      "Eddie began stripping off handfuls of electric green feathers. The dogs \n",
      "crowded him, jumping up to try to get at the bird. \n",
      "Thomas came up behind him. “Eddie?” he said. “What do you think \n",
      "you’re doing?” When Eddie didn’t answer he tried again. “Eddie?” \n",
      "Eddie turned around slowly. He had the eyes of a stranger. \n",
      "“Kukulcán,” he said. \n",
      "“Don’t start that shit with me again. I need you with enough brain \n",
      "cells to help me get out of here.” \n",
      "Carla watched them without much interest. Thomas moved a little \n",
      "closer to her. He could tell from the smell of it that the man with the \n",
      "stomach wound was in real trouble. “What’s happening out there?” he \n",
      "asked Carla in Spanish. \n",
      "Another artillery shell hit, not far from them. Thomas jerked his head \n",
      "around instinctively to make sure the helicopter was still all right. \n",
      "“You can see for yourself,” Carla said. \n",
      "“There was never a chance,” Faustino said. “They are abandoning \n",
      "the trenches, falling back into the ruins. We can hold out here for a few \n",
      "hours, hiding in the old buildings.” \n",
      "“You should be glad,” Carla said, “that I got them fixed up.” She \n",
      "seemed to be making a joke, but Faustino was not amused. \n",
      "“Why don’t you let us go?” Thomas said. “We’re no good to you any-\n",
      "more. We were never any good to you.” \n",
      "“It’s not you anymore,” Faustino said. “It’s the helicopter. With the \n",
      "helicopter you could save the lives of our soldiers.” \n",
      "“No, I couldn’t,” Thomas said. “I could put off their dying for a little \n",
      "while. That’s all. And in the meantime Lindsey and the others would die \n",
      "also. For no reason.” \n",
      "“He’s right,” Carla said. “Give him the key, Faustino. It’s over. They \n",
      "don’t need to die with us.” \n",
      "Faustino took the ignition key for the helicopter out of his pocket. It \n",
      "was about the size of a padlock key. He looked at it for a few seconds \n",
      "and then tossed it in the dirt at Thomas’s feet. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 263\n",
      "“Please forgive the poor manners of my friend Faustino,” Carla said \n",
      "gently. “I’m afraid none of us is having a very good day.” \n",
      "Thomas picked up the key. He felt, for the first time in days, a tingle \n",
      "of hope. He might actually live through this. \n",
      "Faustino would not look at him. There was nothing Thomas could \n",
      "do, nothing he could say. This was not his fight. He had the privilege \n",
      "of simply walking out. Or he could piss his life away, and Lindsey’s and \n",
      "Eddie’s and Chan Zapata’s too, in a completely meaningless gesture that \n",
      "no one would ever know about. It wasn’t much of a choice. \n",
      "He turned around to go start the helicopter. Chan Ma’ax and Eddie \n",
      "stood in his way. Eddie had worked the quetzal feathers into his robe \n",
      "and tied a string of them around his head. If he’d been self-conscious at \n",
      "all he would have seemed ridiculous, with his clumsy short haircut and \n",
      "skeletal face and outsized robe. But he didn’t even seem aware of how \n",
      "he looked. \n",
      "Out in the darkness the dogs were savaging what was left of the bird. \n",
      "“Let’s go,” Thomas said. \n",
      "Eddie ignored him. He was staring at Carla. “Call your people here,” \n",
      "he said in halting Spanish. Eddie’s Spanish was now full of strange con-\n",
      "sonants and glottal stops. Like Chan Ma’ax’s. \n",
      "“Please,” Faustino said. “Take your crazy brother and go.” \n",
      "“You have to stop the shooting,” Eddie said. He ignored Faustino and \n",
      "sat on his heels in front of Carla. “You can’t fight them with the same \n",
      "kind of weapons they use. You have to fight them with your ideas.” \n",
      "“Without guns,” Carla said, “the ideas have no force.”\n",
      "“No,” Eddie said. “With guns, all ideas are the same.” \n",
      "“If we die for the revolution,” Faustino said, “we die as heroes. This \n",
      "gringo madman would have us all die as cowards. Carla, listen to me. \n",
      "This mysticism is your great weakness. It’s no shame to be afraid to die. \n",
      "But you can’t let it rule you.” \n",
      "Carla wasn’t paying attention to Faustino either. She was looking at \n",
      "Eddie. “What are you saying?” she asked him. “What is it you want me \n",
      "to do?” \n",
      "“Throw away your weapons,” Eddie said. “Go to the enemy and take \n",
      "his weapons away from him.” \n",
      "“If they have guns and we don’t,” Carla said, explaining it slowly, as if \n",
      "talking to a child, “they will shoot us. We will all die.” \n",
      "“Some of the enemy soldiers won’t want to shoot,” Eddie said. “It’s \n",
      "264 lewis shiner\n",
      "hard to make yourself want to kill somebody when you can see that \n",
      "they don’t have any weapons. Some of them will do it anyway. Some of \n",
      "you will die. But your victory will be greater.” \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax had been standing there all this time, staring at the \n",
      "ground. Now he leaned toward Eddie and said something that Thomas \n",
      "couldn’t make out. \n",
      "“What did he say?” Carla asked. \n",
      "“He said, ‘You will have help,’” Eddie said. “He means the earth. The \n",
      "earth will help you.” \n",
      "“I still don’t understand you.” \n",
      "“When you go against the gods, it is like trying to swim upstream in \n",
      "a strong river. When you go with the gods, everything is easy. The gods \n",
      "means the earth.” His hands outlined a sphere in the air. “Everything \n",
      "together.” \n",
      "“Nature,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“Yes, nay-chur. My brother Thomas understands. That’s what he’s do-\n",
      "ing now, trying to learn how to go with the gods. Your weapons won’t \n",
      "help you. They only make you sink under the water.” \n",
      "“Carla?” Faustino said. Thomas looked around. Ten or fifteen \n",
      "rebel soldiers crouched in the darkness outside the hut. Thomas saw \n",
      "Righteous there, in his knit Rasta cap, and the small, fierce woman \n",
      "they called La Pequeña. Some of them were bleeding. All of them were \n",
      "blackened by dirt and smoke and gunpowder, their eyes supernaturally \n",
      "white in contrast. \n",
      "Eddie saw them too. “Will you call the others?” he said. \n",
      "Carla stared at Eddie. Thomas knew she was searching for some \n",
      "reason to go against her better judgment and believe him. Finally she \n",
      "looked away. “No,” she said . \n",
      "Eddie nodded. He walked past Chan Ma’ax and toward the soldiers. \n",
      "Thomas suddenly noticed how quiet it was. The shelling had stopped. \n",
      "The Palace was little more than smoking rubble, and there were bod-\n",
      "ies strewn around the clearing. But it was over, at least for now, and the \n",
      "helicopter was still intact. \n",
      "Then he heard the war-cry of Marsalis’s army. It made him want to \n",
      "crawl away somewhere and shake with fear. Carla and Faustino were \n",
      "looking at each other with no hope left in their faces. Eddie didn’t even \n",
      "seem to have heard. He’s completely out of it, Thomas thought. He’s \n",
      "just going to wander off. He didn’t even say goodbye. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 265\n",
      "And then he saw what Eddie was doing. Eddie went up to one of the \n",
      "soldiers and gently took the rifle out of the woman’s hands. He took \n",
      "hold of it by the barrel and brought it up over his head, like he was go-\n",
      "ing to throw it away or smash it against the ground.\n",
      "“I told you no!” Faustino said. The eerie howling of Marsalis’s men \n",
      "was clearly pushing him over the edge. Thomas felt about the same. \n",
      "Faustino scrambled to his feet, shouting, “Give her back the gun! Give it \n",
      "back or I swear I’ll shoot you down!” \n",
      "Faustino was already reaching for his rifle. Thomas didn’t take time to \n",
      "think. He threw a body block and he and Faustino hit the dirt together, \n",
      "sliding across the godhouse floor. Thomas came out on top, straddling \n",
      "Faustino’s chest, pinning the man’s shoulders with his knees. “Leave him \n",
      "alone,” Thomas said. “He can’t hurt you. He’s just crazy, that’s all.” \n",
      "He looked up. Lindsey and Chan Zapata stood at the bottom of the \n",
      "pyramid. Lindsey had her suitcase with her. She was staring at Eddie, but \n",
      "he was oblivious. \n",
      "“Get in the helicopter!” Thomas shouted at them. “Get Eddie and \n",
      "get in—” \n",
      "The ground bucked underneath him. He looked up in time to see \n",
      "the poles of the godhouse going in four separate directions. Then he \n",
      "was buried in rotting palm fronds.\n",
      "Thomas’s nose filled with moldy dust. He sneezed and fought his \n",
      "way clear. The ground tilted and buckled and shook. Below the pound-\n",
      "ing and cracking of the earth he could hear the massive stone blocks \n",
      "of the Temple of the Inscriptions shifting against each other, a horrible, \n",
      "ominous, grating sound. \n",
      "And then, just for an instant, everything hung suspended. He saw \n",
      "Chan Ma’ax standing at the edge of the forest. The other Lacandones \n",
      "were moving into the trees, almost out of sight. Chan Ma’ax was star-\n",
      "ing at Thomas, his expression completely neutral. Thomas tried to find a \n",
      "message there and failed. Then the old man turned his back and fol-\n",
      "lowed the others into the forest and they were gone. \n",

      "Eddie was still standing. He moved through the soldiers, helping them \n",
      "up, gently taking their guns away. He carried the guns over and threw \n",

      "The noise from Marsalis’s soldiers had stopped. \n",

      "“We got worried.” \n",
      "“The others?” Thomas asked, no longer sure if he’d really seen them \n",
      "there in the jungle or not. \n",
      "Chan Zapata looked around. “They were with us when we came \n",
      "down. I don’t know where they went. It doesn’t matter, anyway. They \n",
      "won’t come. Nuxi’ said they will find their own way.” He shook his \n",
      "head. “I will be t’o’ohil with no clan.” \n",
      "“I can’t make them come with us,” Thomas said. “I don’t know if I \n",

      "“I know,” Chan Zapata said. “I think maybe we should save ourselves.” \n",
      "Thomas glanced to his right. “Oh shit,” he said. Eddie had a hundred \n",

      "There were bodies all around. Most of them were rebels who’d \n",
      "crawled back from the trenches to die. Some were wives and kids and \n",
      "parents who hadn’t gotten away from the shelling. Thomas made himself \n",
      "look away. \n",
      "“Eddie!” he shouted. Eddie ignored him until Thomas grabbed him \n",
      "by the shoulders and turned him around. “We have to get to the heli-\n",
      "copter!” he shouted. “We can’t wait around here anymore!” \n",
      "“You go,” Eddie said in English. The rebels had stopped where they \n",
      "were. They all watched Eddie, waiting for him to give them another signal. \n",
      "“Stop acting like an idiot,” Thomas said. “We didn’t come all this way \n",
      "to leave you here to die.” \n",
      "“We’re all going to die, sooner or later.” \n",
      "“You’re crazy. You couldn’t cross the street by yourself, you’re so \n",
      "fucked up.” \n",
      "“Listen to him,” Lindsey said. “Come with us. Let us help you.” \n",
      "Eddie touched Lindsey’s hair. “I think maybe I am crazy,” he said. For \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 267\n",
      "a second he almost seemed like the old Eddie. His eyes were more alert \n",
      "than they had been in days. “Maybe I’m even going to die tonight. But \n",
      "that’s my right. I’ve got the right to live this out the way it looks to me.” \n",
      "“We can get you doctors,” Lindsey said. “There has to be something \n",
      "they can do.” \n",
      "“You know there isn’t,” Eddie said. “Tell her, Thomas. It’s a waste of \n",
      "time. I’m not going to let you take me. I’ll fight you. It could take a \n",
      "long time to get me on that helicopter. And you don’t have the time to \n",
      "waste.” Suddenly he put his arms around Thomas, one hand on the back \n",
      "of Thomas’s neck. “You take care of yourself,” he said. Then he stepped \n",
      "around Thomas and walked away. The rebels closed in behind him. \n",
      "“Thomas?” Lindsey said. “Do something!” \n",
      "Thomas didn’t answer her. It had begun to snow.\n",
      "The snowflakes were tiny and granular and warm to the \n",
      "touch. Thomas held out his hand. Within a couple of seconds the \n",
      "palm had turned gray. Thomas looked at the sky. There weren’t any \n",
      "clouds, but the stars were dimmer than they should have been. They \n",
      "were winking on and off. The air stank of sulfur, reminding him of the \n",
      "chemistry labs at ut. His eyes burned and the back of his throat felt so \n",
      "dry it was hard to breathe. \n",
      "El Chichón. He turned toward the volcano and saw lights flashing all \n",
      "around the crater. Thick clouds of ash boiled straight up into the sky. A \n",
      "stream of glowing brown lava inched its way down the mountainside. \n",
      "Thomas pointed wordlessly and Lindsey followed his finger. \n",
      "“Oh my God,” she said. \n",
      "“Run,” Thomas said. He could see the top of the volcano vibrating, \n",
      "feel the vibration under his feet. He took Lindsey’s hand and dragged \n",
      "her toward the helicopter. \n",
      "“What about Eddie?” she screamed. \n",
      "“There’s no time!” Thomas yelled back. “He made his choice! I’m \n",
      "making mine! You want to stay here and die with him?” \n",
      "They ran. The ground around them was turning gray. Thomas felt the \n",
      "ash on his face and neck, like a heavy coat of talcum powder. He gave \n",
      "his handkerchief to Lindsey and gestured to her to tie it over her mouth \n",
      "and nose. Then they ran again. \n",
      "Chan Zapata was waiting at the helicopter. So was Carmichael. \n",
      "Thomas blinked tears and ashes out of his eyes. There was blood all \n",
      "268 lewis shiner\n",
      "over Carmichael’s shirt and face. “I’m okay,” Carmichael said. “It’s not \n",
      "my blood.” \n",
      "“Oscar…?” Thomas asked. \n",
      "“Dead. The copter’s trashed.” \n",
      "“Ah, Christ,” Thomas said. \n",
      "“What happened?” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“The Cobra—the big gunship—blew us out of the sky. Oscar got \n",
      "shot up bad. He got us onto the ground, but that was all.” \n",
      "“Christ,” Thomas said again. Later, when he had time, he was going to \n",
      "have to deal with this. If it hadn’t been for Thomas, Oscar wouldn’t have \n",
      "been here at all, wouldn’t have had to die. \n",
      "“It’s not fair,” Lindsey said. She sounded bewildered. “He was my \n",
      "friend.” \n",
      "“We got one of theirs, though,” Carmichael said. He was smiling \n",
      "strangely. “And the rebels got the Cobra while it was trying to finish us \n",
      "off. So they’re down to one.” \n",
      "“Who cares?” Lindsey said. \n",
      "“We do,” Thomas said. “It gives us a chance to make it out of here. \n",
      "Let’s take it.” \n",
      "“What is this stuff?” Carmichael said. “What’s going on?” \n",
      "“Volcanic ash,” Thomas said. “El Chichón just woke up. The whole \n",
      "thing could blow any second. Now get in the goddamned helicopter.” \n",
      "Thomas looked behind him and found Faustino huddled in the shel-\n",
      "ter of the pyramid. “Where’s Carla?” Thomas shouted. \n",
      "Faustino pointed to the west. Thomas saw her limping off toward Ed-\n",
      "die’s ragged collection of soldiers. \n",
      "“One last chance,” Thomas said. “You want to come?” \n",
      "Faustino shook his head. \n",
      "Thomas stood there for a few precious seconds, knowing there was \n",
      "nothing else he could do. It would be cruel even to wish him luck. He \n",
      "turned and ran for the helicopter.\n",
      "Thomas fumbled the key into the ignition lock and turned it to \n",
      "the right. He ran through the checklist as fast as he could. Seat belts fas-\n",
      "tened, control frictions off, cyclic centered, collective down, ac circuit \n",
      "breakers in. He started to sweat. Carmichael, in the left seat, stared at \n",
      "him. Wondering, probably, what was taking so long. \n",
      "Battery. Fuel switches. Throttle to engine idle. He checked the \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 269\n",
      "voltmeter. At 24 volts he pulled the trigger on the collective and heard \n",
      "the blessed sound of the engine cranking. The rotors started to turn, \n",
      "showering the windscreen with a fresh coating of ash. \n",
      "Now was when he’d find out if they could still fly. The ash could be \n",
      "clogging the air intakes. The shaking from the mortars and the earth-\n",
      "quakes could have torn loose any number of delicate systems. There \n",
      "could be shrapnel in the engine. \n",
      "Thomas watched the rpm climb. At 40 percent he let off the trig-\n",
      "ger. The turbine kept running, self-sustaining now. He finished the rest \n",
      "of the checklist and shoved it back in the map case. He throttled up to \n",
      "6,000 rpm and eased up on the collective. He’d worry about the fuel \n",
      "and the course and the radio once they were in the air. \n",
      "The ground lurched. He felt his side of the helicopter go down. A \n",
      "crack opened up in the earth between the skids and shot out across the \n",
      "clearing. Steam poured out of the crack. The helicopter was tilting slowly \n",
      "to the left. Fifteen degrees was all it would take. The helicopter would \n",
      "turn over and the rotors would beat themselves to death in the dirt. \n",
      "Thomas yanked up on the collective. They lifted, the torque pulling the \n",
      "nose to the right despite Thomas pumping the left pedal. The tailboom \n",
      "was swinging toward the wreckage of the burning ramada. He pumped \n",
      "the rudder again and pushed them forward and up with the cyclic. \n",
      "The ground fell away. \n",
      "Hot, wet air from the volcano swirled around them, making the \n",
      "rotors lose their grip. Thomas fought the controls, getting the wind \n",
      "behind him and straining for more altitude. The hull began to make \n",
      "ticking noises. \n",
      "“We’re getting shot at,” Carmichael said into the intercom. His voice \n",
      "had a forced calm that grated on Thomas’s nerves. Thomas shook his \n",
      "head and pointed to the front of the fuselage. Rocks the size of the end \n",
      "of his thumb were falling out of the sky. \n",
      "Thomas switched on the radio and scanned through the frequencies. \n",
      "There was nothing in English. Marsalis was not broadcasting. Thomas \n",
      "wondered what that meant. \n",
      "A chatter of static went through the phones and then a shrill voice \n",
      "cut in: “—el Distrito Federal, temblores los más fuertes en la memoria. Y tam-\n",
      "bién en Chiapas y Yucatán—” There was another static burst and Thomas \n",
      "switched the radio off. \n",
      "“What was that?” Carmichael said. “I couldn’t make it out.” \n",
      "270 lewis shiner\n",
      "“Mexico City,” Thomas said. “It’s happening all over. Earthquakes.” \n",
      "Xu’tan, he thought, though he didn’t say it out loud. The end of the \n",
      "world. Just like Eddie had said. \n",
      "The wind shifted and Thomas turned toward the west. The battlefield \n",
      "opened out in front of them. \n",
      "Ashes covered the ground. The trees had dropped their leaves, shriv-\n",
      "eled, and turned into gnarled black skeletons. There were bodies every-\n",
      "where, bas-relief sculptures in shades of gray. El Chichón lit the night in \n",
      "flickering pulses of light that made shadows leap and fade. Even inside \n",
      "the cockpit the smell of sulfur was overpowering. \n",
      "The two armies still moved out on the plain. Thomas saw Eddie and \n",
      "twenty or thirty others moving slowly toward the west, leaning into the \n",
      "wind like travelers lost in a blizzard. Carla was in the middle, surround-\n",
      "ed and protected by the others. They all had scraps of cloth over their \n",
      "noses and mouths. \n",
      "Thomas dropped as low as he dared and circled around in front of \n",
      "them. A storm of ash blew up from the rotors. Finally Eddie looked up. \n",
      "Thomas was sure Eddie could see into the lighted cockpit, could see \n",
      "him there. Eddie pulled the handkerchief down from his mouth long \n",
      "enough to show Thomas that he was smiling. The quetzal feathers in \n",
      "his headband blew back from his face like strands of long green hair. \n",
      "He flashed Thomas a peace sign and pulled up the handkerchief and \n",
      "kept walking. \n",
      "Thomas eased up to 200 feet. He saw one of the rebels stop and pick \n",
      "up one of the futuristic plastic rifles from a wounded US soldier. He \n",
      "turned it over in his hands and then threw it away. He bent over and \n",
      "helped the soldier to his feet. Then the two of them fell back into line. \n",
      "So long, Eddie, Thomas thought. Good luck, bro.\n",
      "Up ahead the ground was split open in a hundred places, some \n",
      "of the cracks ten or fifteen feet across and so deep that Thomas couldn’t \n",
      "see the bottom of them. The Fighting 666th had been devastated. Bits \n",
      "and pieces stuck up into the air where the earth hadn’t completely swal-\n",
      "lowed them: the fender of a jeep, an arm, the stock of a rifle. \n",
      "The rest of the army had collapsed. Thomas saw the muzzle flash of \n",
      "an occasional gunshot, but most of the survivors wandered aimlessly \n",
      "along the edges of the cracks. The rest just sat in the falling ash and \n",
      "stared at the spectacle of El Chichón. \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 271\n",
      "It was like the volcano had done no more than finish the job that \n",
      "Carla and Marsalis had started. The gray, shattered plain was the image \n",
      "of every battlefield in history, all in one. \n",
      "Thomas felt something inside him let go. It was the end of the ob-\n",
      "scure guilt he’d carried around for twenty years, that had started back in \n",
      "high school, watching the nightly body counts from Vietnam. It was stu-\n",
      "pid, he knew, to regret not having gone to a war he knew was wrong, a \n",
      "war where he would almost certainly have been wounded if not killed. \n",
      "But there it was. \n",
      "He’d grown up, like every male of his generation and all the genera-\n",
      "tions before him, with the idea that war was how a man tested himself. \n",
      "It was where he found out what he was made of. Now he saw that \n",
      "people were the same as the tiniest of subatomic particles. The force it \n",
      "took to measure them was stronger than they were. They couldn’t be \n",
      "measured that way without changing them into something completely \n",
      "different than they were before. \n",
      "And of course he’d seen it all too late. He would carry this vision of \n",
      "ash and smoke and fire with him for the rest of his life. Along with the \n",
      "face of the pilot, Fowler, lying in the crossroads, blinking. \n",
      "Thomas climbed higher and banked toward the north. He saw the \n",
      "last of the US helicopters in the distance, flying away from them. It was \n",
      "headed northeast, toward Veracruz. Running away, Thomas thought. \n",
      "Who could blame them? \n",
      "“Look,” Carmichael said, pointing down. “It’s Marsalis.” \n",
      "Sure enough, Thomas thought, pulling the cyclic back into a hover. \n",
      "Marsalis and Billy stood together in the falling ash, turning now to look \n",
      "up at Thomas. Marsalis waved both arms over his head, not realizing \n",
      "that the hovering helicopter no longer belonged to him. Thomas an-\n",
      "swered him by edging up on the collective and taking them up another \n",
      "fifty feet. Marsalis was shouting something. \n",
      "Thomas let them begin to drift away. Billy pulled at Marsalis’s arm, \n",
      "trying to calm him. Thomas was still watching them when something \n",
      "knocked him forward into his harness. \n",
      "An instant later he heard an explosion that seemed to tear the very air \n",
      "to pieces. His head rang and he felt like his eardrums had been shred-\n",
      "ded. It was a full second before he realized that the sound had come \n",
      "from El Chichón. \n",
      "He pushed in the left rudder and they came around to the south. \n",
      "272 lewis shiner\n",
      "They were just in time to see a huge ball of burning ash and gases, yel-\n",
      "low at the center and red at the edges, come hurtling down the slope of \n",
      "the volcano. \n",
      "The entire top of the mountain was gone. \n",
      "Thomas couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He turned in his seat. \n",
      "Chan Zapata leaned forward, staring in awe. The fireball was reflected \n",
      "in the darkened window next to his head. Lindsey hadn’t even noticed. \n",
      "She lay back with her eyes closed, exhausted. \n",
      "“Get us out of here,” Carmichael said. “Now.” \n",
      "“Yeah,” Thomas said. “I guess so.” He spun them back around and put \n",
      "the nose down and cranked the throttle all the way open. \n",
      "He looked down as they began to climb. Marsalis and Billy were mo-\n",
      "tionless, staring east across the burned-out plain. They watched the dust \n",
      "cloud rising from Eddie’s weaponless army as it moved slowly, inexora-\n",
      "bly toward them. \n",
      "Then the figures shrank away to nothing. Thomas flew on into the \n",
      "darkness, toward the coast and the remains of his world.\n",
      "L\n",
      "indsey stared at the ceiling for a long time without \n",
      "moving. Finally she lifted her left hand over her face and looked at \n",
      "her watch. Two o’clock. From the light seeping in around the door she \n",
      "knew it was afternoon. \n",
      "Around midnight Thomas had landed the helicopter in a field outside \n",
      "Villahermosa. He made them walk more than a mile down the highway \n",
      "before letting them rest. The smell of the asphalt and the roar of the \n",
      "passing cars seemed like something out of a dream. \n",
      "Thomas left them sitting behind a billboard and walked on to find a \n",
      "phone. He came back for them an hour later in a taxi and took them \n",
      "to the Hotel Villahermosa Viva, a US-style motel on the highway. \n",
      "Carmichael paid for the rooms, telling them it was all going on his \n",
      "expense account. \n",
      "The place was luxurious in a uniquely Mexican style. The ceilings \n",
      "were high, the furniture was massive, there was a wet bar and a refriger-\n",
      "ator in each room. The huge plate-glass windows opened on a view of \n",
      "Deserted Cities of the Heart 273\n",
      "a brick wall. The carpet was deep pile shag and had a large water stain \n",
      "next to the door. The air conditioner worked, but made groaning noises. \n",
      "None of that mattered to Lindsey. There was hot water, lots of hot \n",
      "water. Afterward she and Thomas crawled into separate double beds and \n",
      "fell asleep. \n",
      "She was still exhausted, but she didn’t think she could sleep anymore. \n",
      "Thomas lay across the room with one arm over his face, breathing rag-\n",
      "gedly. Lindsey sat up in bed and felt her stomach turn over. Her temples \n",
      "seemed to pinch in against her brain. She staggered into the bathroom \n",
      "and let her stomach heave, though there was nothing in it. When it was \n",
      "over she washed her face and brushed her teeth and started back toward \n",
      "the bed. \n",
      "Thomas was sitting up. “You okay?” \n",
      "“Yeah,” she said. “I’m fine. It’s just...” \n",
      "“Morning sickness,” Thomas said. Lindsey nodded. \n",
      "“Jesus Christ,” Thomas said. “You’re pregnant.” \n",
      "“Maybe,” Lindsey said. “Maybe it’s just...everything I’ve been through.” \n",
      "Or, she thought, maybe it’s just wishful thinking.\n",
      "“How long has this been going on?” \n",
      "“It just started,” she said. “I mean, I should be getting my period this \n",
      "week. If I’m going to. But I don’t think I am.” \n",
      "“Isn’t this a little early to be getting sick?” \n",
      "“Kind of,” Lindsey said. “I knew somebody once started throwing up \n",
      "the day after she conceived.” She sat on the edge of the bed, facing him. \n",
      "“I would just as soon you hadn’t found out.” \n",
      "Thomas said, “I would have found out sooner or later. Wouldn’t I?” \n",
      "They hadn’t talked yet about what came next. Lindsey just let the \n",
      "silence hang. \n",
      "Thomas sat back, rubbed at his eyes, put his glasses on. “Who’s the \n",
      "father?” he said. \n",
      "She could have lied to him. But she didn’t want it that way. “You or \n",
      "Eddie,” she said. “I don’t know which.” \n",
      "“Christ,” he said. \n",
      "“It’s not like I’m laying this off on you, okay? It’s my kid. I’m going \n",

      "“If it’s my kid, I am part of it. Me and Eddie are the same blood type \n",

      "at work that she’d always been afraid of. Now she saw how she could \n",
      "teach herself to do something with them. Something that would take \n",
      "her out of the rut she’d been in for the last ten years. \n",
      "And more than that. Chan Ma’ax believed the old world was ending \n",
