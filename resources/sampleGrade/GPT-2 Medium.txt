Sample:
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Luna. She was a young princess who wanted to become a knight. Obviously it wasn't an easy task, and she couldn't fine anyone who would like to train her.

However, the reason was simple. The princess was too young.

The princess had to wait until she was at least eighteen years old to become a knight, but her father was in charge of making sure that she did not become a knight. So, Luna was born in the royal family's castle in a very bad condition. It was so bad that she could hardly stand up.

The reason why Luna was born in such a bad condition was the fact that a person with a very low intelligence was placed on a knight training camp, and he became a knight in the end. The reason why the princess was born with such a bad body was because a certain person was assigned by the princess' grandfather to be the head of the royal family, the king's personal bodyguard.

And that person is now an enemy of the royal family.

That's right, this is what happened in the royal family's castle.

The person who was assigned that position was a man named Gondo-chan.

In addition to being a person with an extremely low intelligence, Gondo-chan's eyes were also very dark.

It was said that he looked a bit like a ghost.

Gondo-chan was a person who was very close to Gao.

Gondo-chan was a person who had always been close to the royal family, and his relationship with the royal family was quite close. He even went to the royal palace to ask to be the next head of the royal family.

It was said that he was a man with a bad personality who was not very kind to Gao, and he did not really like the king.

However, in a very close relationship with the King, he had a very kind heart as the King's son. Gondo-chan was not very good in his relations with the royal family, but he was able to do everything that he can do with the King's permission and with Gondo-chan's consent.

Gondo-chan had always been a person that the king was very friendly to.

The reason why Gondo-chan was a person that the king had been so friendly towards was because Gondo-chan was very kind-hearted.

In his opinion, it is very easy for a person to be kind to the king if he is really like that person, even if the person does not really love Gondo-chan.

But, there is a difference between Gondo-chan and a person like that.

In the Royal family, the King was very strict on people like Gondo-chan.

In fact, Gondo-chan had already died.

The one who killed Gondo-chan was the king's personal bodyguard, who was named the head of the royal guard.

And that was the reason why Gondo-chan's life was so bad.

Gondo-chan's father, the King's father, was the first person to kill Gondo-chan. He did it because the King wanted to make sure that the people in the royal family were not killed.

However, the king was very strict on Gondo-chan's mother.

Gondo-chan's mother was the one who was supposed to keep watch over Gondo-chan while she was at school.

The one who killed Gondo-chan was the King.

The King wanted to make sure that no one was ever killed by Gondo-chan, and the one who killed Gondo-chan was the head of the royal guard, Gondo-chan's mother.

Gondo-chan's father, the King's father, did it to avoid being killed by Gondo-chan's mother. He was the head of the royal guard, Gondo-chan's mother.

In addition, there was also a man named Kaede named Kaede-san who was assigned to keep watch over Gondo-chan.

The King was very strict on the people like Gondo-chan and Kaede-san.

The person who did the most to kill Gondo-chan was Kaede-san.

The one who killed Kaede-san was the head of the royal guard.

And Kaede-san was very good at it.

Gondo-chan was a person who did not like Kaede-san.

Gondo-chan was the one who was supposed to protect and protect Kaede-san.
