Sample:
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Luna. She was a young princess who wanted to become a knight. Obviously it wasn't an easy task, and she couldn't fine anyone who would like to train her.

But when the girl was a teenager, she had a friend who had just become a knight. She was a girl that was a lot taller than Luna. Her name was Luna who had her own name. Her father was a king, but he didn't have the power that he was supposed to. He was the king of a nation that was known as the "Land of the Wind."

Luna's father's kingdom was ruled by the Wind Kingdom. When he was young, he was the only prince of the land of the Wind. He was also the first king to take an apprentice.

One day, a man came to him and asked him to take him under his wing to help him with his kingdom's needs. Luna was very happy and asked for him to be her knight. She was told that she needed the power to help the Land of the Wind.

The man who helped her was her father. He told her that they needed a new knight, and that if he could make the new knight as strong as his father, they could be a real power for the Wind Kingdom. He said that he could take her, but that she would need to have the power to protect her.

Luna's father took her to a village that was ruled by a knight named Tia. Tia's father was a strong warrior. Luna's father wanted to train her, but she was told by the village that they needed a new knight to be able to fight the Wind King. He said that he could take her, but that she would need the power to fight against the Wind King. He asked her to fight for him, and she agreed.

Luna was training for five days and then they went on to the Wind Kingdom to fight against the Wind King.

After fighting for four days, they were told that they would have to fight the Wind King. After two days, they were attacked by a group of Wind King. They had to fight for two days before they could defeat the Wind King. Then, they were told that the Wind King was about to die, that he would be reborn again in five days time.

The Wind King said that if they fought hard now that he was dying and would return. So, they fought until the Wind King returned to life.

Luna had her powers, and she was able to defeat the Wind King.

She was very happy that her father was able to train her so well. He told her that she wouldn't have to train her own body anymore, as she was already training it for training. Luna also said that her father was able to train her so well because she was a princess.

Luna's father then said that the next time that Luna fought in the Wind Kingdom, she would need to fight against the king of the kingdom. He gave his daughter a necklace that would protect her body. The necklace was very important for her.

Luna was given the name of "Mare-sama" in her village to honor her mother.

Mare-sama had a pet cat called "Mare," and she liked to play with it. The two of them played together for many years.

Mare-sama had a big sister named "Luna," and she liked to play with her.

Luna was a very shy girl. She was always looking for someone to play with. But one day, Mare-sama told her that she could have a new friend to play with.

Mare-sama said that she would be able to protect her friend, and that Mare-sama would be a knight.

Mare-sama told her that he would help protect the world, and that she would become a knight. Mare-sama then took her to a village with a knight named "Tia." Tia was another princess who also wanted to become a knight, and he was her father's apprentice.

Tia was a girl who was very beautiful and had the power to protect. Mare-sama wanted to train her, but Tia's father said that they needed someone who could protect Tia as well. Tia said that she would be willing to give her power to him. She then took her to a forest in the Wind Kingdom to fight against Tia's father.

Mare-sama was able to defeat Tia's father. He said that he would take Tia's power and train her to become stronger and stronger.

He was very happy about that. Mare-sama also said that he would take her to other places that he had been to before.
