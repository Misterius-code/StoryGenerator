Once upon a time, there was a girl named Luna. She was a young princess who wanted to become a knight. Obviously it wasn't an easy task, and she couldn't fine anyone who would like to train her.
“I want a sword,” she whispered to herself. “I want a sword with a great sword. It would be 
very cool to have a sword like this.”
She wanted to be an adventurer and hunt dragons as she had in her childhood days. It was just 
her nature to be different, but the idea of the sword seemed to be making things better in her mind.
Luna’s mind was a very bright one, and she was very proud of the sword she was carrying. Her sword was an ebony 
sword, made by the same swordsmiths as the 
Dragon Queen’s, and it was the only sword she was sure she could find in this world. 
She was proud of the way it carried a sword with a great sword. It would be 
cool to have a sword with a dragon’like appearance, and to have that sword as a companion. It was a 
dream, and one of the things that kept her going, to this day.
The sword she was carrying was a beautiful golden one made by a master of 
the same sword crafts as the Dragon Queen. It had a long blade with a beautiful golden tip. It was 
made from an ebony, a beautiful stone, and it had a beautiful golden color.
Luna’s father was a master of all sorts of craftsmanship. His craftsmanship was known 
around the world. He had worked tirelessly for over ten years and was still a master 
in the making.
The sword had a golden color, a beautiful golden tip.
She thought of the time when she first met the Dragon Queen.  She remembered the 
great feeling of power and powerlessness she’d felt when she first saw her. She had felt it in her heart and 
it was the same feeling that drove her to find herself in this world. 
She had found herself in this world, and she had found herself in this world alone. She was the only 
one who felt this way in this world, and that made it easy for her. She 
loved living with the others, but she was lonely because she was not alone. She felt a 
sense of isolation when she was alone. She wanted to stay with those people, but she couldn’t. 
Luna was the only person that was the same.
She was a young princess, and she was the only princess that could find a way to become a knight. Her dream was to 
bring peace to the world, a way of doing things that would 
allow her to protect all living creatures, including dragons. She was determined to make sure that her vision 
would be realized.
She was the only one that had the sword that made her dream come true.
The sword was named after her, and she was happy that it was named after her. She was happy that a sword 
that was so beautiful, so powerful, so strong and so beautiful 
would bring happiness to a world in which she could be lonely and alone. 
Luna was a princess, and that was all she wanted. She was going to make a name for herself for 
her own 
good. She was going to be the best princess ever.
She was ready for her first day of training. She was ready for her first day of training. She was 
ready for her first day of training.
“Good morning,” she greeted the new girl, who was named Luna.
“Hi,” she said, and then she walked off.
“Hi, I’m 
Luna,” she said again, and this time she turned to walk off.
