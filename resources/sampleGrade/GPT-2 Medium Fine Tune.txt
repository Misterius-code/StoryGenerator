Sample:
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Luna. She was a young princess who wanted to become a knight. Obviously it wasn't an easy task, and she couldn't fine anyone who would like to train her. Her father was in the army 
and he was a knight. He was the leader of the Knights of the Round Table, but she’d already earned that title.
Her father was a very wealthy man with a lot of 
wealth and he would have his own palace. He would probably be able to 
afford to send her to his home on another continent to live as his own princess. She’d be 
a princess for life and her family wouldn’t be able to help her if they were to ever leave her. So her 
self-respect and her life as a knight would be taken care 
of by his wealthy father.
She was a princess, after all, and her parents were all rich. So why was she a princess at all?
A knight was a noble man of the court who protected the rights of the knights 
of the Round Table and the king was the chief of the knights.
Luna’s father had a reputation as a good knight, but that was no reason for his daughter to stay. 
If she wanted to be a real knight then she had to be a very good 
boy. If she could be a good boy then she would be a knight.
“No, my daughter, your father wouldn’t let me,” she said, and her eyes went wide when she saw the 
possibility.
She felt like a fool for not wanting to become a knight. She couldn’t have been a knight because her father couldn’t 
even give her his hand, not without some kind of force. So how was she supposed to be a real 
soldier or a warrior, when she wasn’t even sure if she even had a right to be?
“I don’t know,” she said, shaking her head and trying not to let her face show her confusion.
“No, you can become a knight, and I can help you,” she replied, and she looked away, knowing it wouldn’t be the 
last time she’d be asked this question.
Luna looked at her in confusion for another moment. She was a princess, and she was supposed to be 
a princess. What she didn’t know was that being a princess was supposed to be the highest rank of a 
man’’s life.
Her father had always been a good knight, and she knew he would be able to 
take care of her, and she hoped to be able to keep her from ever leaving. Her father 
was the chief of the knights of the Round Table, and her family was 
one of the wealthiest families in the kingdom, but she had no right 
to leave, not without the best of intentions.
“My mother and father would never allow it, but I know they would be willing to help. My father is one 
of the Knights of the Round Table, and if my father is a knight then they will be 
ready to help me.”
Luna smiled at her mother and looked at her father, and she knew he was willing to help her. She knew his 
father was willing to be a knight, but she still felt so helpless. 
“You don’t need to be such a princess for my father to help. You can become one by becoming a 
soldier and a warrior if you so choose.”
Her father was a good man. He was a good knight, and his daughter had earned it by becoming a true 
soldier. She wanted to stay with her father, even though she was a princess, even though she didn’t want to 
be a princess, even though 
he wouldn’t let her stay.
