Long time ago was a Hobbit which wanted to be a king well, a dwarf.

Not that the dwarf needed Gandalf for his seat; he was a fine man. He had fought many battles, and had defeated many champions. He was a great fighter, and a champion fighter has a mind for grand names. But he was not a warrior who had won many great victories. He was a warrior who had slain many dragons, or had won a life of torture. A warrior has a life. But he was not a warrior, nor was he a king, or even a king, when Bilbo lost his life, and the dwarf was killed with him.

Gandalf was an old man, and fat, and very fat, but very polite and fond of his small animals. He was always in the last of his reckoning, riding with Bombadil, and with all the Riders; and he was always in the last of his reckoning as a farmer. He was a good sort, very polite and very kind, and fond of his small wit. He would not talk to Gandalf if he did not know the plans of making his house and his hall a place for the kings and the dwarves.

He was a good king. His father was a better king than Bilbo had ever seen, and he was a better king than Thorin, who had been defeated and defeated in the War of the Ring, and who was dying. His father had been a stout man, but the others had not been much impressed with his strength and wisdom and bravery, and he was a better king than the last king before the War of the Ring, or the last of them. He was a better man and his people had never been defeated.

Gandalf and his house were always crowded in the yard, especially by dwarves. There were no more songs and dances, or songs of honour, or songs of praise. All was dull silence and dreadful laughter. The noise of the dwarves making merry mantlets was like the noise of a sea breeze, and the laughter of the dwarves was not at all cheerful or joyful.

You must take my advice, said Gandalf. If you can find anything to do, it may help to tell the story to the hobbit, and learn what theyre like and make of them.

It is a long tale, and full of adventures and misadventures, and I like it best, said Bilbo, and I wish to hear all the talk of it. But the dwarves are all in one house, and they usually get together before nightfall, and they do not like each other at all, so they make sure that they do not make any noise or pinched every word. And the story goes on and on.

It is not as if Bilbo knew that the story was not true. He was not in the book, of course, and he was missing all that much. The story goes that when the dwarves began their journeys, they found a great stone on its bottom, overhung with great roots. It made a hole, and a long tunnel ran down from underneath, and a stairway led up to it. But the dwarves soon found it only a tunnel for a moment or two, and that was before the dwarves had any rest.

They were in a place where the roots began to turn, from under the stones to the sides of the tunnel. It was in this tunnel that they found the dwarves of the house and the dwarves of the house, and there they made the best supper and the best sleep that they could get. And there they found some of the dwarves with small children, and some with a big fire in their hands. But they were all very fat, and all had so many toes that they couldnt get on the feet of the dwarves. And they were all too happy to talk.

And then they came to the door of the house and they saw that there were no ones inside. The dwarves were all very sad, and the children were all crying. And there was a great noise and the fountain of noise, and there was gold everywhere and bottles in it. And dwarves were washing their hands and putting their shoes on the floor, and the fountain was full of gold.

The dwarves did not go to bed yet. The dwarves went on talking to one another in the dry little hours. They went on all about the business of preparing the supper, and they talked all the time. In the end they all stopped bickering and argued.

The fire was not put out, but the dwarves put out their flagon. The dwarves washed their hands and put out their mattresses. They washed their boots. The dwarves put out their trousers, and they put out their coats. They washed their breeches and put out their hose. They washed their breeches and put out their boots, and they put out their boots! It was all so much
