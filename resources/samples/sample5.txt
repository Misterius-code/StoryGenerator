Once upon a time, there was a young boy in the village.Everbody in the villeage called him Robert. His dream was to become a Wizzard. He did not know that his dream will fulfill soon. However not the way Robert wanted. One chill
night when everybody in the village were celeberating a Kupala Night which is a shortest night in the year. A dragon attacked village by setting every house on fire. It look liked a hell came into earth. Evervbody in the village
went dead despite one young boy. The next moring a Wizzard found Robert and took it for traning.
Robert went to his village to find out what happened to him. When he got there, he found out that he was taken away by a dragon. Robert tried to fight the dragon, but he could not do anything against it. After a while, Robert got
 tired of fighting and decided to go to sleep. But when he woke up, the whole village was dead. There was no trace of Robert anywhere. No one knew where he went or why he left.
The next day, a man came to Robert's village and told him that Robert had gone to the forest and died there. This man told Robert that if he wanted to live in peace, then he should go back home and live with his family. So Robert
 went back and found his father and mother. They were very angry at him for leaving them and said that they would kill him if they ever saw him again. Then they took him away and left him to die in a forest. That was the last tim
e Robert saw his mother and father. In the end, they killed him and buried him in his own grave.Â 
After that, nobody knew who Robert was. Nobody knew his name or what he did for a living. Even now, no one knows where Robert came from or how he died. People think that it was just a dream or something like that. Some people eve
n say that there is no such thing as a "Wizzard" and that the only thing that can be said about him is that "Robert" is the name of a mythical creature that lives in this land called "The Land of the Wizzards".
