SUPERNATURAL SMACKDOWN
Adrian Mitchell
Name: Adrian Mitchell
Book Series: Renegade Angels
Job: Captain of the Sentinels, an elite special ops team of seraphim tasked with punishing the 
Fallen
Height: 6’3”
Weight: 200lbs (minus wing weight)
Hair Color: black
Eye Color: flame-blue
From (Location): presently headquartered in Orange County, CA
Significant Other: Lindsay Gibson/Shadoe
Signature Move: lashing out with his wings, which are impervious to mortal weapons and 
feature razor-sharp tips that slice like blades
Kill Highlights: ripping beating hearts straight out of the chest cavity, decapitation, evisceration, 
limb severing, mind warping
Enemies: Syre, Captain of the Fallen and leader of the vampires
Favorite Pastime: flying (via his wings or with state-of-the-art aircraft–he heads a cutting-edge 
aeronautics corporation) and seducing Lindsay–preferably both at the same time.
Other Facts: Aside from giving up Lindsay, there’s nothing Adrian won’t do to complete his 
mission–misdirection, torture, twisting minds into insanity, death… The ends always justify the 
means.
I remember quite vividly how I came to be here at this Supernatural Smackdown. I was working 
in my home office when Damien showed my visitor in. I glanced up briefly, intending to tell Ms. 
Day that I didn’t have time for her that afternoon when the brilliant red of her pants caught my 
eye. Flannel, I noted, before looking out the window at the beautiful Southern California 
weather. I returned my attention to her as she helped herself to one of the chairs facing my desk. 
My gaze narrowed and I tried to figure out what the atrocious pattern on her pants was.
Frosty the Snowman, I realized with more than a little horror. The woman had come to see me in 
her pajamas.
“Ms. Day,” I said, leaning back. “I know you spend an inordinate amount of time occupied with 
writing your books, but surely someone told you it’s September.”
She blew a stray strand of hair out of her face. “I know what month it is, Adrian. That’s why I’m 
here.”
I took in the haphazard way she’d clipped up her hair and the lack of makeup, and sighed 
inwardly. She could be moderately attractive when she chose to be. Apparently, I wasn’t worth 
the effort. “Well, fill me in, then. I’m busy.”
“Don’t take that tone with me,” she retorted, foolishly believing I wouldn’t hurt her if I had to. 
She’s always been too confident because I sought her out. She probably thinks that means I need 
her. “You have an appointment, and if you don’t leave now you’ll be late. They’ve already 
emailed and asked where you are.”
Setting my elbows on the armrests of my chair, I steepled my fingertips together, as if in prayer. 
I do occasionally make an attempt to update the Creator on the status of my mission, but it’s 
been a very long time since he’s paid any attention to me.
“I’m never late,” I reminded her. “At least not when I’m aware I need to be somewhere.” She, 
however, is rarely on time. In the nearly two years we’ve been working together, I’ve waited on 
her countless times.
“Don’t tell me you forgot the Supernatural Smackdown. I know Lindsay reminded you.”
The event sounded vaguely familiar. My head fell back into the headrest as I thought about it. 
“Ah, yes. I remember now.”
“Good. Now, go kick some ass.”
I savored the savage rush of bloodlust. I’d been agitated for days and was still working on 
seducing Lindsay Gibson into my bed. With sex not yet an option, a death match was the second 
best stress reliever.
“I know that look,” Ms. Day said with narrowed eyes. “Don’t forget this is an exhibition match. 
No killing.”
I stilled. “Beg your pardon?”
“You can’t kill anyone. It’s just for sport.”
“Oh, no,” I crooned softly, pushing leisurely to my feet. “If you think I’m going to put on a show 
for you, you’re as mistaken as I was when I came to you with my story instead of Kresley Cole 
or J.R. Ward.”
She tried to hide it, but she pouted a little. “That was mean. It wasn’t easy working with you, you 
know. I did my best. I’ve never worked harder on a book.”
I rounded my desk with an unwelcome twinge of contrition. For all her faults and foibles, she 
wasn’t half-bad as far as mortals went. There were times I found myself… liking her. “I’m 
sorry.”
She blinked. “Oh my god, I have to write the date and time down for posterity.”
The moment of affection faded as quickly as it had come. “Send Lindsay.”
“I can’t.”
“Why not? She’s an expert with knives, a brilliant marksman, and she’s too fearless for her own 
good. She’ll have a blast.”
“I love Lindsay,” Ms. Day said. “I would’ve broken you two up if I didn’t.”
I was infuriated by the mere thought and my wings materialized in a visible manifestation of my 
irritation. They emerged as ephemeral wisps of smoke before solidifying into alabaster feathers 
with crimson tips. I stretched them out, flexing them to shake off my increasingly volatile mood.
“See?” she breathed, her gaze soft and dreamy. “That’s why you have to go.”
I snapped my fingers in front of her face. “Ms. Day. Focus, please. Mortals aren’t supposed to 
know we’re here among them, remember?”
“This is a special circumstance. Everyone’s coming out of the woodwork for this event. They’re 
all showing off their signature moves. You’ve got to show them how you deflect bullets with 
those beautiful wings. And how they spin around you so fluidly, like a cape, when you’re in 
battle.”
“I’m not a sideshow amusement. Find someone else. Or let me kill something. Your choice.”
She looked at me with compassion I didn’t want. “You don’t how much longer you’ll have 
those,” she said gently. “Not now that you’re with Lindsay.”
There was no need to say more. I knew what I risked by loving a mortal, but I wouldn’t change 
how I felt about Lindsay even if I’d been given the option to. She was everything to me. The 
reason I pushed through every day and looked forward to every night. The reason I might one 
day lose my wings.
“All right,” I said, holding out a hand. “Give me the address.”
So here I am. Who’s ready to get wing-slapped?

BLACK AGNES
Adrian Mitchell
“What’s spookier than a graveyard a night?  One full of vampires, warrior angels, and statues 
that come to life.  Sylvia Day’s Adrian Mitchell from the first book in the new Renegade Angels 
series, A TOUCH OF CRIMSON (available now from Signet Eclipse), is telling us a suitably 
scary and sexy version of the Black Agnes urban legend.” 
~ AllThingUrbanFantasy.blogspot.com
Adrian Mitchell tossed the crime scene photos on the dining table in his hotel suite, watching 
them fan outward as they slid across the glass. “We’ll be staying a while.”
The two lycans seated at the table reached for the images, dividing them between them.
Unable to look at them anymore, Adrian pivoted and walked to the massive window overlooking 
the city of Phoenix, Arizona. Fighting his unwelcome agitation, he unfurled his wings, the 
pristinely white feathers with their crimson tips emerging first as tendrils of smoke, then 
solidifying into shape. He stretched and flexed them, the only sign of his disquiet hidden in what 
would be perceived by the lycans as a simple bid for comfort.
“Black Agnes,” one of them said behind him.
“Excuse me?” Adjusting the angle of his position, he looked at the two men examining the 
photos. One was stocky, built for brute force. The other was taller, leaner yet stronger. He’d 
watched them work, noting their strengths and weaknesses. They were a good team and a good 
match for him. Together they’d taken down three rogue vampires in less than two weeks. He 
expected to add this latest one to their kill sheets before they headed home again.
The taller one—Elijah—lifted his head and looked at Adrian with the luminescent green eyes of 
a creature tainted with demon blood. It was that touch of demon that enabled the lycans to 
shapeshift between man and beast. It also indentured them to Adrian. “An urban legend. There’s 
a cemetery statue—two of them actually—of a hooded figure. One was rumored to have 
supernatural properties. College kids used it as a pledge to join sororities and fraternities. The 
initiate was supposed to spend the night sitting in the statue’s lap, but one of them was found 
dead in the morning, with bruises and marks that suggested the statue had come to life and held 
her until she croaked.”
“That’s not a shrouded figure,” Adrian pointed out, his voice kept carefully neutral to hide his 
roiling fury. He was a seraph, a Sentinel. He was expected to stand above the vagaries of human 
emotions. But he couldn’t fight his reaction to the pictures spread out before him, those of a once 
beautiful young woman laid dramatically upon the lap of a massive marble statue of an angel. An 
angel whose head was bowed as if weeping over the bloodless body draped across its thighs.
A taunt. An undeniable “fuck you” from the vampire who’d taken the very last drop from a 
promising life.
“No,” Elijah agreed. “This rogue is a young one. Too stupid to know better.”
Only one who was young and foolish would deliberately attract the attention of a Sentinel. 
Adrian’s mouth curved grimly. “And he’ll get what he’s asking for.”
* * *
When night fell, they split up and cruised the college parties and local hangouts. They attracted 
attention, predators prowling through gatherings of their prey. Men shied away from them 
instinctively, but the women were drawn to that edge of danger. With focused attention and 
flattery, it was easy to get them to talk. By the time Adrian regrouped with Elijah and Trent, 
they’d each gathered intel on upcoming pledge initiations, many of which now included the 
cemetery statue due to its morbid notoriety.
Adrian looked up at the moon. “Our vamp isn’t going to wait. We’re here, and now that we’ve 
canvassed his haunts he knows it. My bet would be on another strike tonight, one last show of 
arrogance before moving on.”
“The cemetery, then?” Trent asked.
“Right. Let’s go.”
* * *
Having lived for millennia, nothing surprised Adrian anymore. He’d seen everything, countless 
times. Or so he’d thought.
From his vantage in a tree a half mile away from the statue, he tracked the young couple crouch-
walking toward the massive angel, laughing softy and pausing occasionally for breathless kisses. 
He watched them reach their destination and lean against the marble in a passionate embrace. 
Her hands slid through the young man’s hair as he took her mouth with more enthusiasm than 
skill. Then he lifted her onto the angel’s lap, putting her at the perfect height for him to step 
between her legs and push up her pleated mini-skirt.
Dropping from the tree, Adrian approached carefully, eyes on the prize as he waited for a sign 
that he was dealing with more than just an ordinary set of horny college kids. He was distantly 
aware of Elijah and Trent on the perimeter, holding back to keep their scent from reaching the 
sensitive nostrils of their vampire quarry.
The girl’s head fell back with a sigh of pleasure, exposing the creamy expanse of her throat to 
the greedy slide of her boyfriend’s parted lips.
Then Adrian saw the soft amber glow of her irises.
His brow arched. Well, then.
Her furtive hand signal alerted him to the presence of the others, warning him to shift into the 
shadows of a massive tree for cover. The pack converged from points behind the young man, 
four vampresses, their fangs gleaming in the moonlight. Their gender took him aback, although 
he would later wonder why it had. Although they hid it well, females were usually more vicious 
than males.
The girl on the angel’s lap shoved her would-be lover back into the waiting arms of her laughing 
friends. Adrian engaged, darting forward, going for the victim. Catching him up in the center of 
the pack, Adrian snapped his wings free, spinning fluidly. The razor-sharp tips of his feathers 
sliced like a circular saw, halving the vampires at the waist in less than a second. As the pieces 
fell to the ground with sickening thuds, he delved into the young man’s mind and removed all 
memory of the night, resetting his recollections back to the point when he’d met the vampress at 
a frat party.
Then he faced her, the ringleader. She cowered into the arms of the angel, caged by Elijah and 
Trent in their lupine forms. But when her gaze met Adrian’s it was hot with defiance and 
swirling with madness.
  Plucking her off the statue, Adrian rifled through her memories, confirming her guilt in the 
previous attack and discovering the tragedy of her Change. She’d been caught just this way by a 
young rogue and his friends. The attack had stolen her sanity; the Change had taken her soul, as 
it did all minions. What was left behind was one of the monsters he hunted.
Nevertheless, pity stirred in his chest.
“I’ll find the ones who did this to you,” he promised softly. Then he ended her.
In the morning, several dozen white lilies were found in the lap of the mourning angel statue. 
And in the years that followed, it became known as an unusually peaceful spot, one where 
visitors felt a joyous equanimity and departed with a renewed sense of hope in the days to come.

AUTHOR OVERRIDE
Interview with Adrian Mitchell
I’m not overly surprised to find Adrian in a pensive mood when I visit him for this interview. I 
know he’s under a great deal of pressure now, although he hides it beautifully, as always.
I find him in his office, looking out the window at the native Southern California landscape. His 
hands are clasped beneath his wings and his inky black hair touches the collar of his dress shirt, 
having grown longer over the last few weeks as his world has steadily unraveled. Those beautiful 
wings of his, so pristinely and blindingly white except for the crimson tips, reveal so much about 
him. I wonder if he realizes that. He can hide them at will and the fact that he’s chosen not to do 
so today tells me how agitated he is. They stretch and flex when he’s of a mood, the only visible 
sign he gives of how he’s feeling.
I know it’s those feelings that are exacerbating his problems now. He’s a Sentinel, after all. An 
angel created to hunt and punish other angels. He was designed and built to feel no emotion, to 
function almost like a machine. A Terminator, perhaps. One mission, one purpose, no deviations. 
But he’s deviated a lot over the years. Now more so than ever before. And he’s paid the price. 
He’s paying it even now.
“Hi, Adrian,” I say in greeting, although he knows I’ve been standing here watching him.
He faces me and I’m struck, as I always am, by the brilliance of his cerulean eyes. All of the 
Sentinels have blue eyes and he explained why when I asked him previously. The Sentinels are 
seraphim angels—the “burning ones.” The blue of their irises is literally the flame inside them. 
Pure and hot. Beautiful in an eerie, preternatural way.
“Ms. Day,” he returns, in his smooth deep voice with its unique resonance. He can compel with 
that voice, but so far he’s resisted compelling me to do anything. At least I think he’s resisted... 
“Ah, you’re dressed today. I’d almost forgotten how you look when you’re not wearing your 
pajamas.”
I grin. “Hey, it’s one of the perks of being a writer. How are you today?”
“As well as can be expected.”
“Where’s Lindsay?”
“Training.”
I nod, understanding. The woman he loves can kick some serious ass, but she’s still fragile 
compared to the vampires she hunts and the Sentinels who are training her. “Are you ready for 
the interview?”
“No.” But he moves to his desk, gesturing for me to take a seat.
His wings dissipate like mist just before he sits, which always fascinates me. They’re so much a 
part of him and yet he can tuck them away where mortals like me can’t see them.
I eye him as he gets comfortable, admiring the savage beauty of his face. He’s stunning, with a 
dark and edgy sensuality that makes him seem more fallen angel than not.
“What do you like most about yourself?” I ask.
His brows rise. He leans back in his chair and studies me in return. “Is this part of the 
interview?”
“It can be.”
“Hmm... That I can still learn, I suppose. That I can change my mind, be surprised, discover 
something new.”
“You’re evolving.”
“Yes, perhaps that’s the way to say it. After all these years... after all I’ve seen, I’m not done 
formulating new opinions of things that should be old hat to me.”
“What do you like least about yourself?”
His lips curved wryly. “How much time do you have?”
Now it’s my brows that rise. “Really?”
“Part of evolution is trial and error, and I’ve made more than my share of mistakes. 
Unfortunately, I also keep making new ones.”
“That’s part of being human,” I point out.
“But I’m not human.”
Right. I consider him further. “What haven’t you done that you would like to do?”
“Take Lindsay away,” he says without hesitation. “For a week at least, longer if we could 
manage it.”
“Where would you go?”
“She likes the water. I like the mountains.”
“So you can fly.”
“Yes.” He smiles, which is a sign of how Lindsay is changing him. “So I suppose it would be 
somewhere with mountains overlooking the ocean.”
“Something to look forward to.”
“Yes.”
“What are you most afraid of?”
“Failure,” he responds, with the same alacrity as the previous question. “Too much is riding on 
me... too many people are dependent on my getting the job done. There’s too much at stake. And 
I have Lindsay now.”
“You won’t fail.” I have no doubt about that.
“No,” he agrees with conviction. “I won’t.”
And really, that’s the number one thing there is to know about Adrian right there.

Monday MANdy
Interview with Adrian Mitchell
Have you ever melted a trackball on your Blackberry?
No, but I’ve crushed a few in my fist when I’ve been aggravated enough.
What is the one thing you find most interesting about mortals?
Decisions are so mutable to mortals. Sayings such as, “Rules are made to be broken.” Even when 
the lines are clear and it’s apparent they’ve been crossed, emotions guide the response to those 
transgressions as much as the law does. That fascinates me. There are so few hard and fast rules 
in mortal lives and so many reasons you come up with for why a particular rule applies in one 
instance and not another.
Looking back, now that you have Lindsay in your life, is there anything you wish you had 
done differently regarding Helena?
I’m torn by this question. Helena came to me for two things: permission to break a law and help 
in doing so. It was rather like one police officer approaching another to ask for permission to rob 
a bank, assistance with disabling the alarm systems, and then a promise that she’d face no 
consequences for the theft. Can you see how impossible it was for me to give her what she 
wanted?
There’s precedence for what could happen if I’d made a different decision. Syre was faced with 
the same situation when he fell in love with his mortal mate and he responded differently. He 
gave the Watchers permission to do as he did and the result was that they all fell, even those who 
hadn’t taken mates. He damned them all for his mistake. In his situation, most of the Watchers 
had fallen in one way or another—certainly his permission was encouragement for some—but 
my Sentinels have stayed true to their mission. Aside from Helena and me, the rest have been 
inviolate. How could I risk all of them for the transgressions of just two of us?
That said, I could have been a better friend.
I had two roles with her—leader and friend—and I focused on the first to the detriment of the 
latter. I should’ve asked for more time to think. I should never have proceeded so quickly, when 
I was still reeling from the knowledge of her fall. I wasn’t thinking clearly. Then Lindsay left 
and I was barely thinking at all. It’s possible Helena didn’t realize that I haven’t escaped 
retribution for my sins. Lindsay, too, believed I’d face the same punishment as the Watchers, but 
that’s not my fate and I’ve always known that. Losing Shadoe over and over again, losing 
Phineas, knowing I’m no better than those I’ve punished, the sacrifice Lindsay ended up making 
for me... Even Elijah’s very existence. It’s no coincidence that he entered my life at the same 
time as Lindsay, wielding the power he does over the other lycans.
My punishment is insidious, like a spreading stain, eating through everything that has meaning to 
me. Everything I’ve worked for and believed in is crumbling around me. That is my punishment, 
and I should’ve shared it with Helena, armed her with the knowledge she needed to make her 
own decision without asking me for permission.

Shadoe, her soul once more inhabiting a new body that doesn't remember him. This time he 
won't let her go.
With no memory of her past as Shadoe, Lindsay Gibson knows only that she can't help being 
fiercely attracted to the smoldering, seductive male who crosses her path. Swept into a dangerous 
world of tumultuous passion and preternatural conflict, Lindsay is soon caught between her angel 
lover, her vampire father, and a full-blown lycan revolt. There's more at stake than her love and 
her life—she could lose her very soul...

An Exiled Knight and the 3rd Princess, 
A terrible combo
Volume I
Prologue – The Savagers 
The Algard Empire’s Capital Place. In the courtyard. The 
scenario was something like this  
 A young man about in his 17s 
Was found kneeling on the floor with two guards casting 
their swords on to his head and He was wearing an armour 
of the Algard Kingdom, He had brown coloured hair. He 
gave a weird feeling of unhappiness, to full-fill that he was 
tied with mana absorbing chains, which were held up the 2 
soldiers who had their swords on his neck. He was 
surrounded by 2 parallel lines of men, mainly consisting of 
nobles and higher military general of the Algard Kingdom. In 
th
front of him, was the 14  King of the Algard Empire, his 
Majesty the King ‘Flourus von re Algard ‘
“Rayce Welford of the eastern border, as an act of treason 
you are here exiled from the Empire of Algard and your 
arms will be taken by the Empire” A officer from the royal 
court of Algard
“Furthermore, your titles and properties would be taken 
away by the Empire and given out the Nobles” The 
properties of Rayce Welford were slim to none but his titles 
were second to none like ‘The holder of the demonic sword 
of destruction’ or like the ‘ dragon of destruction’ or ‘the 
knight in black and red’, a person’s title determines the 
strength of the power they held, A person’s power varies 
with the difference between there titles. If someone 
acquires someone’s else title, they are directly obligated to 
the person power and strength even thou they aren’t worthy 
of it. In this world getting a good title is the only way to get 
recognized, by taking away Rayce’s title the King ensured 
that there was no way he could ever show his face to 
anyone and giving his title to a nobleman would make the 
person a perfect fit for a royal consort.
“Knight Rayce, Rayce due to the disrespect of the act of 
civil violation who should live a life of an exile and your titles 
will be removed” Rayce heard these words as left the royal 
court. His armour was torn apart beyond recognition by the 
numerous one-sided Knights.  
*
About 10 days ago, The eastern border- 
“Knight Rayce do you really intend to fight, there is just no 
way you could ever fight such a group of this size.” A group 
of almost of 37 soldiers were standing in front of Rayce, 
they were the soldiers which stood beside Rayce when he 
had to fought the invading nation of Glehara   
“I told you that I am the knight in black and red, I will never 
give up at least until I don’t know what to do” Rayce had his 
usual face of an overconfident knight who was facing death. 
He had earned the title ‘The knight in black and red’ by 
sheer hard work, he had to mastered 2 magical elements 
without any formal education and he also learnt a 
swordsmanship befitting a noble which all was done in total 
of 3 years which was as close as the time the hero of light 
took to conquer the demon lord’s domain and establish 
peace with the demon race. Rayce knew that  this was a 
plan made by the Earl Edmar Brice, he had a plan going for 
about 2 weeks which included the submission of Knight 
Rayce as an exiled. He wanted to make the young Knight 
attack the soldiers  of his domain. If a soldier fights with 
another soldier or is killed by one the attendance, the 
audience would be exiled, thou this law is to be broken in-
case of self-defence, Earl Edmar made it sure that all the 
soldiers  s under Knight Rayce were given about 10 gold 
coins to transcribe their words. 
The currency used in the Empire of Algard is Altus where 
10 Altus = 1 copper coin, 10 copper coins = 1 silver coin, 10 
silver coins = 1 gold coin and 10 gold coins = 1 Algard coin 
and 10 Algard coins = 1 Shattonie coin. A Shattonie coin 
also known as the world coin it prize remains the same 
everywhere you go in this world. As Algard is the biggest 
and the most powerful nation now its second currency the 
Imperial coin or the Algard coin, its value changes with 
accordance to the place. To put it simply 1 Altus = 1 Dollar 
so then I gold coin is equal about 1000$ so Earl Edmar 
gave the soldiers  s of Rayce about 10,000$ which were 
used to bend them according to his will. 
“Let the Flames of hell Burn through my blade” A purple 
flame fire covered Rayce’s sword as he rushed towards the 
soldiers. 
“You…… are just weak pathetic humans, who won’t give a 
shit to loyalty” As Rayce started saying these words his 
body stared to shape shift into a very distinct looking 
humanoid dragon. His body was covered by dragon scales 
with a blue hue, one sharp pointed tooth stuck out from his 
lower right side of the jaw, his brown eyes turned into a 
bright golden colour a small horn came arising from the 
midpoint of his nose. As he touched his sword the sword 
turned purple and darker as he grabbed it from its 
scabbard, his arms which were the only part which looked 
like that of a human now had transform into that of a 
dragonborn.  
“I will say this last time, come back with us Rayce obey him, 
accept your fate” The man leading the army of soldiers 
yelled at Rayce. He had his sword drawn out indicating that 
he would order a forward march on Rayce at any point of 
view if he disagrees.
“Looks like you will need to try something else to draw me 
out” Rayce gave a huge glare towards the man in-charge. 
This made cleared that Rayce had totally declined the 
proposal of the opposition. He knew that he had no chances 
of winning thou Rayce was one of the most powerful 
Knights of all time still there was no way he could ever take 
all of them at once. The men who were send after Rayce 
were the Holy Imperial Knights (now at least) all he could do 
was try to not die. And that was how the Knight Rayce 
Welford was brought to the court of Algard and then later 
Exiled.   
*
The Royal conference hall 15 days ago 
The King seated himself at the head of the table which was 
followed by the seating of his council and the ministers of 
the state along with some good and absolute trustworthy 
nobles. “Are the Preparations been met” The King spoke in 
a loud voice indicating every one that their seat was at 
stake. “Your excellences here is the list of the attendees 
you wanted, those whose magical power level ranks 
beyond the A rank” As one of the council members passed 
a booklet towards the King which he grabbed as soon as it 
reached his hands. “We would really love if we were briefed 
about the reason why we are called here today in the 
meeting of the council” A group of the nobles spoke up to 
the King hoping to get a good and reasonable answer as 
now they were in the danger of losing their title as nobles. 
“Oh, looks like I didn’t even tell you about it” The King 
nodded towards the council “Carlos could you just do the 
work for me”
“As you all know the battle against the Uralia Empire has 
ended as well as the conquest of the demon lord, so 
therefore there is no need of the knights who are stronger 
than an A rank adventure. Thus, our Empire is the power 
source of the entire world. This is a big achievement for our 
Empire but at the same it is in a difficult state to keep. On 
research there is a possibility that the Empire will fall in the 
next 25 years with rise in power of the Knights and the 
military generals.” As one of the council members 
concluded his thoughts about what he was ordered, The 
Earl Edmar opened this loud mouth and started to speak. 
“So, what do you want us to do now” Looking at the 
ministers and the King at the same time, “If you really want 
us to surrender our armies towards you, your excellence, 
you know it’s an impossible order to follow.” A member from 
the council followed “Earl Edmar, we don’t want you to 
surrender your or anyone’s army, we just want to get rid of 
every Knight who is stronger or ranks above the Standard 
A rank of Adventures Guild” The King wanted to get rid of 
all these Knights or military generals only because he had a 
feeling that ones with power might revolt  the system and 
ultimately take down the Empire.
And so almost entirety of the Empire’s Knights (above A 
rank) were taken down. Knights who were taken out were 
came to be known as the Savagers. They were exiled from 
the Kingdom of Algard and were charged almost 10 times 
the normal tax rate if they wanted to keep living in the 
Kingdom. Many of the Savagers were also targeted by 
bounty hunters, thou bounty hunting is illegal in Algard it 
was permitted for the bounty of Savagers. People hated the 
Savagers as the Pope had named them the enemy of God. 
But leaving that Savagers are still consider as a member of 
the society thou only some people treat them equally, 
before getting Exiled each and every Savagers had the 
spell of Eneefled casted upon them. Eneefled a SS rank holy 
magic spell a spell which is even difficult for an S rank 
adventurer, it forces the target to abandoned over 50% of their 
total magic power which means each and every Knight who 
was above or an A rank now would be somewhere between D 
to C rank. Getting rid of their Titles and now that of their 50% 
power they were expected to perish, but their 1000 hours of 
training didn’t go to waste they were easily able to live a 
stealthy and a slow life among the commoners who treated 
them equally and fairly. A group of knights known as the 
Creation Knights were loyal to the King and the council as well 
as to the nobles, they were all somewhere near the S rank 
boarder leaving them, every one of the Knights were forced to 
get rid of their power and titles. The Job of the Creation Knights 
was to ensure peace and freedom of the Kingdom. They were 
given the title of a noble and were feed properly and had 
constant power checks along with over 100 spies on them. 
Their only job was to look after the security of the kingdom and 
maintain national law.          
 <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Care for it as if it were your own, or watch it melt to ash and bone. Words that echoed in my mind as I edged my way through the forest. The trees were spread sparse, and lay bare. Their dark, silvery trunks clinging to the ground through exposed roots; roots that wove their way across the grim, grey dirt. I had to be careful not to trip as I walked, the entire forest floor was laden with them.

The air was still. Not a sound floated through it, save the crunch of my boots on the dry, dead ground. And that’s what this place was, or at least seemed: dead. There was no colour, no life. The forest seemed empty, devoid of anything you might expect to see in a woodland. No animals, no water, no sunlight breaking its way through the canopy. The lack of leaves would have left the whole forest to bath in the warm glow of the sun, were it not hidden beneath perpetual cloud.

I came to a steeply crested dirt mound. Either side were trees, jagged roots and felled decaying logs. It seemed to be my only way forward. In my attempts to scramble up, I lost my footing and fell forward. I wasn’t quite sure how, my foot felt planted one second, then as if the ground was gone the next, but it didn’t matter. I had made it over the rise but landed on my stomach in the dirt. Peeling upright as quickly as I could, I frantically checked my pocket. To my relief, there was no harm done. My prize was safe. Dusting myself off, I continued onwards, heading deeper into the forest.

“Nasty isn’t it…”

I flew around, a haunting voice catching me by surprise. My heart in my mouth, my breath caught in my lungs, I found myself peering down at a haggard old woman, head spun with dry and curling white hairs. She was sat against the base of a tree, wore a tattered old white dress down to her feet, no shoes and a crooked smile.

“To be caught off-guard by a scary old woman in the middle of a forest” she continued, her smile broadening. I nodded frantically in agreement.

“What brings you out here?” She pressed. “Alone”.

Her expression was warm but her eyes were cold. They were like the forest around me. Lifeless and empty.

“Nothing”.

“Nothing?” She replied, sceptically. “I doubt that very much.”

“What are you doing out here?” I asked, trying to turn the conversation to her.

“Hmm? Oh, just sitting.”

“Sitting?”

We looked at each other, an eerie smile on her face, what I imagined to be nerves on mine.

“I better head this way,” I said after a pause, edging away from her.

“Oh yes, you better had.” The old woman croaked. “It’ll be getting dark soon.”

I nodded awkwardly at her, scurrying away. Before I could move out of earshot, I heard her call.

“Must be very valuable, whatever is in your pocket.”

I turned back to answer, to lie or question her knowledge of what lay beneath the fabric of my clothes, but there was nobody to respond back to. The woman was gone.

With every hair on my body stood on end, I carried on. I had to be there soon, or must at least be getting close. She was right, though, it was getting darker. It was impossible to know how high the sun was in the sky. Between myself and the clouds was a high floating mist that wafted through the treetops. It scattered what little light crept its way through the clouds, destroying all indication of the placement of the sun within the sky. All I knew was, I was losing light. I shuddered at the thought of being caught out here in the dark. Waking to a wrinkled old crone standing over me, fumbling at my pocket and scared me half to death. She’d already done that once, I suppose if she came back and did the other half she’d finish the job.

I could feel the fear etching its way into my body. A strange sensation of heat on my skin, despite the cold. A feeling of movement in my stomach, without any food inside it. And a distortion behind my eyes; the world was the same as how I always knew it, but somehow looked different at the same time. Like I was seeing more detail, my unconscious mind looking for things it normally wouldn’t. Like creepy old ghost women.

I didn’t want to be here anymore.

The only way out was forward. I marched on, watching my footsteps carefully. I would seemingly trip every time I looked up, like the roots beneath me were tricking my eyes. Where I thought was clear was suddenly not. This forest was shapeless, aimless, it just kept going. But then, my heart sank, as I came to a familiar sight. A crested dirt mound, this time with scrapped boot marks down the rise. I approached it cautiously. To either side were trees, felled logs and jagged roots. There was no mistaking it. Carefully, I climbed, watching my feet as I went. With a hop I sprang over the ridge and immediately cast my eyes around the trees, turning back to check for old, haggard strangers. But there was nobody.

“Nasty isn’t it…”

I gasped as a jolt of shock struck me deep within my chest.

“To be caught off-guard twice by a scary old woman.”

Slowly, I turned back around. There she was, stood barefoot in the dirt. Hunched over, neck twisted, peering up at me through the spirals of hair falling down her face.

“What’s going on?” I demanded, eyes darting around the forest for other potential surprises. The woman had not been there mear moments ago, and the trees were spread so far apart around us that there was no way she could have appeared from behind one of them.

“I would like to see the treasure you carry”. She said softly, wearing the same broad smile.

“It is not for you,” I said, trying to strike my tone with some form of confidence while carefully shielding my pocket with my hands.

The woman’s smile dropped to a sneer. She folded the hair out of her face to reveal a harsh and angry expression, yet those eyes still held nothing but emptiness. No emotion, nothing. “There is only one reason people visit this forest. Only one reason they travel so deep.”

“Get away from me, crone!” I wailed, sprinting round her, my hands still covering my pockets. I ran deeper and deeper into the forest, zig-zagging between the gnarled roots as fast as I could. I kept the pace for as long as I could, constantly switching between tracking my movements across the floor — careful not to trip — and looking up for signs of repetition. Eventually, after a fairly lengthy, yet cautious run, I started to tire. I wasn’t the most physically fit of individuals. I came from wealth, I didn’t have to be.

Panting, exhausted and pleading with my own head for signs of the creature that I sought, I came upon a particularly dangerous looking patch of roots, stretching on ahead of me into the far distance. They spun up in all directions, curved and twisted, some even looping twice over before burying themselves back into the ground. It seemed like they were fleeing the very earth itself.

I looked around the desolate landscape. No sign of women, or crests or anything familiar; except a brutally grey and unappealing forest. I broke off my pace and opted for a slow walk through the entangled roots. Eyes firmly at my feet, I made steady progress for all of thirty seconds, then I glanced up.

There is was. The crested dirt mound. Right before my eyes. How? What had happened to the swarming roots? There was no way I’d made my way through them. Shaking, but with anger and fear, I put my hand forward and climbed. Eyes darting about the place, I kept myself moving, circling as I went, looking for the old woman. I didn’t want to be surprised again.

But she wasn’t here. I couldn’t see her anywhere. I stood for a good few minutes, in the dead silence of the forest. Waiting for her to appear. She didn’t come. I could feel my mind slipping away from me. I was becoming desperate. The sun didn’t appear to be moving. It was still fading, and had been for what seemed like hours. I couldn’t see a way out. How could I escape a forest that could change its shape at a moments notice? Nobody had warned me this forest played games with you. That a witch lived between its deathly edges and tangled roots.

Slowly, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my prize. A mottled green egg, slightly larger than a chicken’s, lay in my palm. I held it out before me, gazing at its smooth shell. I felt a coldness behind me. Not a breeze, more like that cold feeling of placing your hand near frozen water. An aura.

The woman appeared. Shuffling past my shoulder, she came to a kneel in front of me. She too gazed at the egg. Again she wore that same smile. Again her eyes, though wide and fixed upon the egg, were lifeless.

“Leave it here, and I’ll let you go”. She whispered, eyes still fixed upon the striking little egg.

“I know what happens if I let go of it.” I whimpered. I was afraid, but not more afraid than I was of dying, cold and alone in this forest.

“Do it.” She urged.

“Go on. Take it from me.” I said, a pleading note clear in my quivering voice.

“Just put it on the ground.” The witch breathed with a gesture towards the floor.

“Why don’t you just take it?”

“Put it on the ground.” She was becoming agitated again. The smile wiped from her face. Her anger was building. “Put it on the ground and leave!”

I watched her for a moment, wondering why she wouldn’t just take the egg. Then, cautiously, I reached out with one hand. As I slide my hand towards her skin, it floated away like mist. She really was a ghost; an apparition.

“You have no power here,” I said under my breath. “You can’t do anything to me.”

“I can trap you in this place until you’re too weak to carry on.” The witch screeched at me. “I’m giving you a chance to leave here alive.”

But the wheels were turning in my mind. I was starting to piece it together. What was happening. Not how it was happening, mind, that part still eluded me, but what was causing my confusion, my lost sense of direction and inability to avoid the crested dirt mound. I could see the witch growing anxious, she twitched as she crouched before me, watching me intently.

“You can only control what I cannot see,” I said finally, cracking a small smile.

She gazed at me, blankly for a moment, seemingly lost for words. When she spoke, she didn’t say what I thought she might. She didn’t question what I knew, she didn’t ask me why or how I’d figured it out. No, instead, in the softest, and weakest of voices, she just said: “Please don’t.”

I rose quickly. I kept my eyes on the horizon and I walked onwards, straight through her. I did not let my vision waiver from the direction in which I walked. I stumbled, I tripped and fell. Cut, bled and bruised. But she couldn’t trap me if I didn’t take my eyes off the path.

“Wait!” I heard her voice behind me. “Look!’

“No!” I called out, not turning my head even an inch.

I had a newfound sense of confidence. I’d beaten her, I’d beaten her magic and her tricks. I felt a surge of energy within my body, my fear turning to determination. From behind a tree ahead of me, she came into view. She appeared to be sobbing, or at least, sad. I refused to look at her directly, my eyes were looking nowhere but dead ahead. As I walked past her, she started to scuttle along beside me.

“Please!” She begged. “Please. Drop the egg and leave. You are making a mistake.”

“This is my task. This is how I look after my family.” I replied firmly, shaking off her feeble attempts to sway my decision and pull me off course.  

“I cannot take it anymore. Please, don’t do thi-” But she was cut short. We’d arrived. I had been so close for so long.

Before me was a clearing in the forest. Within it lay deep crater entrenched by roots and fallen trees; within the crater itself, was what I set out to find. The creature hummed softly. A low, baritone noise. It was an almost perfect half-sphere, about the size of a small cottage, sitting dead centre, in the heart of the crater. Its skin was a harsh pink mixed with tinges of brown, and all over its body were placed long, barbed spikes. It reminded me of a more jagged looking sea urchin; a delicacy we often treated ourselves back home. It had no face, eyes, nose or anything else you’d normally associate with an animal. I supposed they may be under its striking shell.

A quick glance at the witch told me she was devastated by my find. She shrank down onto all fours, clutching the lip of the crater, looking down on the otherworldly beast in the pit below.

“I can’t…” She moaned. “I can’t go through this again. Please don’t make me”

“It is not for me to help you,” I replied harshly, fed up with the trickster’s tactics. “I am here for a reason, and I will see it through.”

I left the sobbing woman on the edge of the crater as I slid down its ridge, towards the animal. It made no movements towards me, nor did it react to my presence. The smell was horrific. Like rotting food and gone-off meat. As I reached its massive form, I placed the egg on the floor beside it. The egg shattered into a pile of ash, the small bones of the chick that had laid inside spilling out onto the ground. The creature seemed to sense this. With a rumble, it crept towards the pile of ash and bone, its swollen body contorting in and out as it went. Within moments, it had engulfed the remnants of the egg. All I heard next was some rather unpleasant sounds of sloshing and gurgling, presumably as it ingested the remains in a mouth that lay somewhere beneath its hulking shell. There wasn’t a lot about this journey that I had expected to happen, but I knew all about this bit. My family, those that had heard tales of trips made before, had told me in great detail.

The creature started to glow, its pink skin hews turning a deeper red. Beneath the skin’s surface, a fiery orange seemed to be erupting, flowing its way around the beast’s body like lava. It glowed a vibrant glow in this dark, desolate place. Then, it seemed to latch itself to the floor, and the ground began to shake. Around me, I could see the roots of the trees twitching, starting to twist and turn even more so. They made their way further and further out of the ground. The trees that stood on the edge of the clearing began to crumble and fall helplessly into the crater, yet so weak and hollow, they didn’t roll or come crashing down the ridge, but instead gently slid, crumbling into smaller pieces as they went. The crater itself was growing in size, as the dirt ridge collapsed around us. I had to watch my balance, careful not to fall as the vibrations grew in intensity. In the frantic scene, I took a quick look around.

The witch was gone.

A few minutes after it began, it all stopped. In that time, the crater had grown, the roots had leapt further from the earth and trees had fallen into the pit all around us. The creature itself was much larger as well. It’s vivid red and orange skin returned to its normal pink state. Again, it was humming softly. I stood, watching the animal. Waiting for what I knew must come next. It had to… it couldn’t not. It took some time, time enough for me to grow increasingly nervous, but eventually, the giant started to convulse in and out again, as it very slowly crept away from me.

The patch left behind was drenched in a thick white mucus which billowed from the ground like steam, evaporating into the air. With no wind or breeze to speak of, it rose straight up into the mists above. And there it was, laying in the thick of the slimming mess, a gleaming blue stone. Clambering into the ooze, my shoes sticking to the ground as I went, I grabbed the mucus-encrusted stone and made my way swiftly out the crater, using fallen trees and roots to haul myself up to the edge. Sitting on the lip of the enormous pit, I wiped the slim off the gem with my clothes. It was a perfect circle, a glowing blue pearl. The size of my cupped hands, it shone without any light reflecting into it. I couldn’t have asked for anything so stunning. This gem was perhaps the most valuable single item anyone could get their hands on right now, and it would keep my family in great wealth for a century.

I left the forest, nearly skipping, overjoyed. The gem was hidden beneath my clothes, I couldn’t let anyone know I had it. Not until it and I were safely home. Nobody but the inner circle of my family knew of this place. If anyone were to discover it, our fortune would be ripped from beneath us. Soon, I came to the crested mound, but this time I was facing the other way.

“I used to be young and beautiful you know.” The Witch was waiting for me, on the other side of the crest. Some of her silver hair had fallen out since we last met. She looked more wrinkled, was hunched over in a cruel arch and spoke with a very weak and croaking voice. “You’ve taken this all from me.”

“Everything must have an end”. I replied, matter of factly, now very much unafraid of the deathly figure before me.

“And what will you do when I’m gone. When this is gone?” She gestured to the forest around her. Decay hung in the air, the trees were looking wilted, the bark of the roots cracking. “I cannot take much more.”

“I don’t care,” I said honestly. “What I care about is getting what I need right now. And I have what I need. You’re still here, aren’t you? The forest still stands. We’ll try and give you longer to heal this time… Maybe that will keep you going a little longer.”

“It’s not enough.” she sobbed.

“It’s all I can give you.” And with that, I left. I walked away from her. Hoping I would never to hear from her or see her again. Somebody else would have to come back here, of course, but I wasn’t going to be me. I’d be long dead. <|endoftext|>

CHAPTER I
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
I lived a great many summers indeed.  For as long as I can recall, I have dwelt here, in this cozy little 
cottage atop a mighty timeless mountain.  Truly timeless.  I confess I do not know exactly how long my 
own life has lasted, but that I cannot remember the day of my birth.  The years of my mortality faded into 
the sands and the rocks, leaving not a trace for any to follow.  All I am is an old man who refuses to let 
death claim him.  An effortless gesture of defiance at this point.  
Gates of sandstone long since barred my stained glass windows.  To light the space in which I find myself 
sitting, I utilized a special potion that casts light from any sort of treated object.  I have been using stones, 
as they last the longest.  In fact, I only need to venture outside once a month to restock.  The 
mountainside leaves a lush bounty, plentiful enough to suit my needs, and for what it cannot, a village 
sets at the base of the mountain.  The people there are kind enough to lend me wares and food with no 
thought of reward.  I knew them for a while, though I cannot recall any faces.
I am finishing a meal when I hear a quite unexpected noise usher forth from the south.  As if brought on 
by swift winds, I hear a knock at my door.  Surprised, I lift up these old bones and make my way over. 
Honestly, the last time I had a visitor was ages ago, so I cannot entirely remember when that was exactly. 
It must be the wind, or some animal playing too close.  It could be a sick bird flew into my door.  No, that 
last part couldn’t be right.  The knock came thrice, so it must be three sick birds … or one quite insane.
The knock comes thrice more, a gentle tone surprisingly.  I lift up the latch and swing it open, anxiously 
awaiting a spectacular vision of six birds, but alas, it is a young man.  His hair is a dark hue of brown, his 
skin tanned from the unrelenting sun beating through the opening.  The air is quite hot.  It must be 
summer.  
“Excuse me,” he says in a timid voice.  “Are you the immortal of whom they spoke?”
“That depends, boy,” I reply.  “What have they told you?”
“Can I speak with you this day?”
“Of course, my boy.  Come inside.  Company is always welcome.”
After he enters, I close the door behind him and flip the latch shut for now.  The young man has a 
determined expression behind his eyes.  His clothes are tattered and worn from his travels.  He crossed 
some distance to speak with me, though I imagine I am not the final step in the journey he has planned.
“So you live here, cut off from the world?” he asks.
“It is the only way to keep my sanity, boy.  Friends, family … even you will pass soon, youthful as you 
are.”
“That is why I sought you out, sir,” he stammers.
“Please, call me Gregory.”
“Gregory, sir, I … I want to become an immortal … like yourself.”
Hesitantly, I answer, “Really now?”
“I want you to teach me the ways of an immortal,” he insists.
I have neither the knowledge of this young man’s history, nor his reasons for seeking me out, but there is 
one point I should make doubly clear before we further this conversation.
“What is your name, boy?” I ask him.
“Daniel,” he replies.
“Daniel, your wife and children will wither before your eyes.  Everyone you know will fade from this 
existence, and your great nation … along with its teachings and ways of life … will crumble to the 
ground in a mere century or two.”
“None of that matters.  As an immortal, I will live to do great things.  I will take all that goes with it if I 
can change the world for the better.”
“Determined aren’t we?”
“I do not intend to leave without an answer.”
There they are again.  His eyes … determined, though transient.  We will see.
“I will not train you based on a moment of passion.  Come back in five summers.  If you can wait that 
long, I will train you.”
“Thank you, sir.  I will be back in five summers.  Mark my word.”
He flips the latch and as he leaves, I call out to him, “Safe travels, my boy.”
CHAPTER II
A DYING WISH
The new day greets my eyes in a blinding coat of ebony shade.  I wake up from my bed, scarcely able to 
see anything as I shake off the tattered blankets made of fine fabrics.  Some patchwork will have to fit in 
there sometime soon, but that can wait.  I reach over to my bedside to grab the phials I created from the 
former afternoon and to feel the handful of rocks worn down from the previous coating.  It's an acid, so 
rocks are the best and most resilient choice.  Popping the stopper, I pour the solution over them, coating 
the stones in a fine light as the liquid potion reacts to their surface.  A few seconds, and the tones of light 
flood the cottage, allowing me to see as clear as if it were daylight.  
My body and mind lost their connection with the great shifting earth, but in here, I feel as if it is now 
morning.  Maybe something remains ... or is it that I want something to remain?  Truthfully, five summers 
is quite a long time to wait for the boy's return.  I doubt even I am that patient.  What was his name again? 
I believe it began with a 'D.'  Danielle? No, I'm certain it was a man.
Wholly to my surprise, I hear a knock at my door not seconds after thinking these thoughts.  Another 
visitor?  So soon?  The odds the knocking is actually a flock of birds grows significantly higher this time, 
though I suppose it would be rude not to answer otherwise.  I open to door and find my gaze fixated a bit 
lower than last time.  Instead of a young man, I see a young boy not more than twelve years old.  He 
looks up at me with wide eyes and speaks with a stutter.  
“M ... my father has ... f ... fallen ill,” he tells me.
Listen, “There is no reason to fear me, boy.  Say what you need to.”
“He ...” he continues with a pause. “He can't come to get it.”
“Get what?”
“I ... Im ... Immer ...”
Oh, I see now!
“Ah, so then your father is the man who spoke with me earlier?”
To which the boy answers, “Yes.”
“Right then.  So, he has fallen ill,” I say with a chuckle.  “I hardly think it's much to fret about.”
However, my words fall short of the boy's lack of interest.
“He ... told me to tell you ... he is not strong enough to come here.”
So, my suspicions held some merit, but, “Giving up already?”
The boy shakes his head and tells me, “He wants ... you to give it to me instead.”
Oh, I see.  Well, “If the old man has given up so easily, what reason should I have to trust you will not as 
well?”
“I ... I ... don't ...” he stutters as I stare him down.  It is true.  He doesn't know, but he cares for his father 
enough to make the trip up the mountain.  Let us see if his passion is timeless.
“You can wait for five summers,” I tell him.  “Come back then, and I will honor your father's request.”
He stumbles out the door and reassures me, “I will come back.”
However, there is, “One more thing, boy.”
“What?”
“I neglected to tell your father, so I'll tell you.  It will be easier seeking immortality if you have no heirs. 
It makes the transition easier, if you take my meaning.”
“For my father's wish, I will do as you say.” 
CHAPTER III
A SPITTING IMAGE
A morning and afternoon passes its way like a breeze through the stagnant air of my cottage as I fiddle 
with all sorts of contraptions.  I've cooked a nice bowl of soup from bits of bird I found outside.  It is 
rather exquisite, to be honest, though the flavor is lacking somewhat.  I should take a trip down to the 
village soon ... ah, but that won't be for at least three weeks.  Could I part with routine ... just this once?
As I sloppily slurp the last bit of liquid from my spoon, I hear another knock at the door!  Who in the 
blazes could this be?  The pounding shakes my delicate walls, rickety old things not meant for the youth. 
Fine!  I'll answer it this one last time, but not once again until at least five summers.
I swing open the hatch and shout, “What in the lord's green...?” and then I pause.
“You recognize me?” he asks.
“Of course, lad.  Come in.”
He sits down on a dirt-caked rug, waiting for me to follow suit.  The young man looks the same as before, 
but his eyes are not quite in accord.  Nevertheless, I meet his gaze at his level.  It takes a few moments for 
this old man to crouch firmly, but I'm not out of it yet.
“You weren't very sick then, were you?” I question him.
“I never was, sir,” he replies.
I see.  Well, “Then either you or your boy is a liar.”
Surprisingly, he answers, “I don't have a boy, sir.  Remember?”
“Not particularly.”
“You instructed me not to bring up any heirs.”
What kind of game is this?  Any fool with half a wit can see through this horridly absurd impersonation.
“Don't toy with me, Daniel!” I shout.  “I won't have it!”
“You speak of my father, sir.  I've waited five summers, as you asked.”
Detestable!  
“You waited an afternoon and wasted my time so far ... get out.”
“But sir ... master Gregory!”
“I will not be prey to trickery, boy!  Five summers was the deal, and five summers it shall stay.”
“I ... I waited.”
“You are a liar and a scoundrel!  Out with you!”
CHAPTER IV
A FINAL REQUEST
The boy has indeed learned his lesson.  I doubted at first that my words could change a man's heart, 
though truthfully, I heard little more than the whipping mountain wind for the past three days.  It's a calm 
silence broken occasionally by the rhythmic tone of mother earth.  It fades into the echoes of the 
mountain peak, and I hardly notice if I don't pay close attention.  
Supplies are running dry as of late.  The foul are nearly gone and what little morsels are left are beginning 
to succumb to rot.  Even my preservatives are no match for mother earth in the end.  Of course, eating 
rotten food won't kill me, but it won't taste pleasant either.  Running out of good stones too.
For some reason, the noise of shuffling catches my fancy, scraping along outside the cottage door. 
Rodents maybe?  Certainly not birds.  I'm slowly becoming sure of that by now.  The sound of wood 
knocking on wood comes next, like a stick or staff.  It hits once.  After a few minutes, it hits again.  I hear 
a large resounding thud, like a sack of potatoes plopped on the ground.
“Hello there?  Are you a sack of potatoes?”
A sack of potatoes wouldn't be able to come forth with an answer, but seeing as no answer made itself 
known, the odds shifted considerably in my favor.  I might have a grand soup tonight.
Casually, I open the door to see a winded old man leaning up against one of the outer walls.  Clutching 
his walking staff and huddled on the ground, he doesn't notice much of anything.  
“Can I help you?”
He slowly shifts his gaze upward, two eyes filled to the brim with tears.  For a moment, the old man does 
nothing but look, coarsely panting to restore his lungs.  After some minutes of silence, he utters a few 
choice words.
“It has been some time ... hasn't it ... master Gregory?”
“Excuse me?”
“I ...” he stutters, “I realize now.  You've no idea ... do you?”
“Apparently not.  What business have you with me?”
He stares even more strongly.
“I waited, Master Gregory.”
Who told him my name?  Was it that foolish boy?
“Am I to suffer these visitations for the rest of my days?”
“I waited years ...” he explains, “the whole of my life.  I'm not sure how many days I have left, Master 
Gregory.”
“It is your fate, sir.”
He grasps my robes with bony fingers, pleading, “It doesn't have to be.  Teach me the ways of being an 
immortal.  You can't possibly refuse me if I can't possibly wait.”
Each one more impatient than the last.  This is the final straw.
“I won't do it.”
“You ... you jest ...”
“If you heard of me from the traveler Daniel, let him know I rescind my offer.  I won't teach him ... and I 
certainly can't help you.”
“But ... but you promised!” he begs.  The tears roll effortlessly down his parched lips.
“I promised nothing,” I answer.  “Besides, it takes years to learn.  You simply don't have enough time 
left, I'm afraid.”
“I ... I forsook everything,” he tells me.  “I hold no possessions ... no wife ... no heirs ... nothing ...”
“Then your passage into the next life will be easier still.”
“I've wasted my life ... for all of this.”  His grip loosens and then the old man releases his clutch.  With 
what little strength he has left, he picks himself up by the staff and begins the long journey down the 
mountainside with a single step.  “I will be back.  I will be back with an army to cut you down.”
Those words ... I believe I've heard them before.  It matters little, though.  The great sun rises and falls, 
despite its immeasurable power, but time conquers even that.
EPILOGUE
TIME CONQUERS ALL
Weeks pass as I toil with my potions and machinations.  Days roll by one at a time so quickly I hardly 
notice, but I've been keeping track on a calendar.  It's an old piece of stone with markings I've etched for 
the days and years.  It has been nearly a month since I last spoke with the old man.  He hasn't returned, 
despite his feverish intent.
“It's time, I think.”
The last of my supplies succumbed to total rot and an unbearable stench permeates every layer of my 
cottage.  I take the time to gather my supplies.  I've an old satchel nearly worn to shreds, but it'll do. 
Enough to carry some goods.  I can trade for a better one with some of my potions.
My wares all wrapped up together, I creak open the door to let in some long deserved moonlight.  I'd 
rather it be day, but the wait won't be long.  Starlight riddles the sky.  However, as I gaze downward, 
toward the base of the mountainside, there are a great many flames of red and yellow darting across the 
landscape.  So small.  I can hardly make them out from here.  Some kind of festival?  
“What's this?”
Off down the mountain path a ways, there lies a pile of bones.  They look old, the meat cleanly picked 
from them and bleached from months of sunlight.  I'd call it an animal, but a human skull rests amongst 
the clutter.  The lot isn't more than a few paces off.  Strange...
“I can't believe I never noticed it before.”

Introduction
Welcome to Harborsmouth, where monsters walk the streets unseen by humans…except 
those with second sight.
Whether visiting our modern business district or exploring the cobblestone lanes of the 
Old Port quarter, please enjoy your stay.  When you return home, do tell your friends about our 
wonderful city—just leave out any supernatural details.
Don’t worry—most of our guests never experience anything unusual.  Otherworlders, 
such as faeries, vampires, and ghouls, are quite adept at hiding within the shadows.  Many are 
also skilled at erasing memories.  You may wake in the night screaming, but you won’t recall 
why.  Be glad that you don’t remember—you are one of the fortunate ones.
If you do encounter something unnatural, we recommend the services of Ivy Granger, 
Psychic Detective.  Co-founder of Private Eye detective agency, Ivy Granger is a relatively new 
member of our small business community.  Her offices can be found on Water Street, in the heart 
of the Old Port.
Miss Granger has a remarkable ability to receive visions by the act of touching an object. 
This skill is useful in her detective work, especially when locating lost items.  Whether you are 
looking for a lost brooch or missing persons, no job is too small for Ivy Granger—and she could 
certainly use the business.
We can also provide, upon request, a list of highly skilled undertakers.  If you are in need 
of their services, then we also kindly direct you to Harborsmouth Cemetery Realty.  It’s never 
too early to contact them, since we have a booming “housing” market.  Demand is quite high for 
a local plot—there are always people dying for a place to stay.
FROSTBITE
“What a beautiful cat, Miss Granger.”
I frowned, but let the comment slide. I didn’t have any pets, not unless you counted the 
dust bunnies collecting beneath my desk.
Jess “Jinx” Braxton raised a questioning eyebrow, but I shrugged. I didn’t have anything 
helpful to share with my rockabilly business partner. The frail woman tottering along at Jinx’s 
elbow either needed new glasses or she was nuttier than weresquirrel poop.
Mrs. Boyd wouldn’t be my first loony client. Working for a client who sees things that 
aren’t really there is an occupational hazard when you advertise as the city’s best (and only) 
psychic detective.
Who was I to judge? One of my special talents is the ability to see through glamour. A lot 
of supernatural creatures use glamour to hide in plain sight, and my gift cuts through the glitz 
and glitter of vampire compulsion and faerie magic.  It’s not as fun as it sounds. I’ve seen things 
no human should ever see.
Second sight is a blessing and a curse.
Monsters walk the streets of Harborsmouth. If it slinks, slithers, flies, or oozes, I’ve 
probably had the dubious pleasure of making its acquaintance. The fact that some of those things 
cross the street to avoid me hasn’t escaped my notice. A detective’s job is to take note of the 
little things, the small details that can break a case wide open, but having anthropomorphic snot 
treat you like you smelled worse than a troll fart could give a girl a complex. Some things are 
best to ignore or chalk up to sunny disposition.
I gave our client my best smile and waved a gloved hand at the seat in front of my desk. 
She flinched and latched onto Jinx’s tattooed arm, huddling like a gryphon chick beneath its 
mother’s wing. My partner shot me a warning glare and I toned down the charm.
“So, what can we help you with, Mrs. Boyd?” I asked, leaning back in my chair.
Best not to scare the client, at least not before she paid. Jinx reminded me of that often 
enough, and she kept the books. If she said we were in the red, then we were hemorrhaging our 
last pennies. Magic weapons and protective spells don’t come cheap, and Jinx complains when 
we run out of food. So, I rested my gloved hands on the desk where my client could see them, 
adopted a relaxed pose, and tried not to let the woman’s cat comment stir up painful memories of 
my childhood pet. Fluffy was dead and there was no sense living in the past. Surviving in the 
present was hard enough.
“Please, call me Maggie,” she said, taking a seat.
Mrs. Boyd, Maggie, cast a nervous glance toward Jinx. I sighed, but nodded for Jinx to 
stick around. It looked like we’d be working this case together.
The fingers on my right hand reflexively went to my forearm, checking and double-
checking the comforting presence of the silver-tipped iron blade hidden beneath my leather 
jacket. Something had our client spooked and Jinx was the people person in our little business 
venture, but having my partner leave the office set my teeth on edge. She was organized, great at 
keeping me on track, and sweet as cherry pie to our clients, but my partner had a knack for 
personal injury. We didn’t call her Jinx for nothing.
“Okay, Maggie,” I said. “How can we help?”
I held my breath, trying not to fidget in my chair. Maybe this would be an easy case, 
something completely mundane. Not every case was fraught with danger. Jinx might finally 
make it through a case without bumps and bruises.
So why were my insides being torn up by a pack of rabid vampire bats?
“It’s my house,” she said, waving her hands. Her cheeks flushed and her over-bright eyes 
darted between Jinx and me. “It’s haunted.”
That was doubtful. There are a lot of weird things that exist in Harborsmouth. I knew that 
more than most. But I’d never seen a ghost.
 I put on my best poker face, leaned forward, and made a show of picking up a pen and 
flipping open my notepad.
“Can you describe this ghost?” I asked.
“Oh, the place is quite haunted,” she said. “There’s more than one ghost. I’m sure of it.”
“And what makes you say that?” I asked.
“Furniture moving, moaning, groaning...that sort of thing,” she said, blinking rapidly.
Jinx mouthed “pooka orgy?” from over Maggie’s shoulder, and I had to stifle a giggle. 
My lip twitched, but I’d learned the hard way not to act like a crazy person in front of the clients, 
not until the check cleared.
“Have you noticed anything missing?” I asked, pen tapping a blank sheet of paper. 
“Spoons? Candleholders? Jewelry?”
“Nothing like that,” she said, shaking her head.
Well, that ruled out Jinx’s pooka orgy theory. I’d worked a few pooka infestations, and 
the supernatural rodents were notorious for stealing anything shiny that wasn’t nailed down with 
iron. The only thing the bacchanalian critters liked more than an orgy was thievery.
“You’re sure?” I asked.
“No, the only thing I’ve lost is weight,” she said. “Which is strange since I’m hungry all 
the time. Not that I’m complaining. I was carrying around more than a few extra pounds before 
moving here last month.”
That was hard to believe. The woman was gaunt to the point of emaciation. I narrowed 
my eyes and turned my head, trying to see through any lingering glamour. Most of the time, my 
gift works on its own, whether I want it to or not, but sometimes it needs a nudge.
“You moved here recently?” I asked, making a show of taking notes.
Sneaking up on the truth works in tricky cases, but all I saw in my peripheral vision was a 
frail woman in need of a sandwich. Something strange was going on here, and I had a bad feeling 
that I’d have to use my psychic gift before this case was solved.
You see, I’m twice cursed. Not only do I have the gift of second sight, a gift I’d happily 
return, but I also get visions when my skin touches certain objects. During a vision, I slip into a 
memory and experience events through the eyes of whoever left a psychic impression behind. 
The trouble is, it takes strong emotions to leave behind a psychic impression, and most things 
that make a person feel that deeply are painful or terrifying. Experiencing that much fear isn’t 
healthy, and there was a very real risk of losing my sense of self, becoming trapped in someone 
else’s nightmare, but sometimes it was the only way to solve a case.
Psychometry was a dangerous gift, but it paid the bills.
“Were there any belongings left behind by the previous owners?” I asked, chest 
tightening. “Or any rooms that weren’t fully renovated before you moved in?”
“Oh, yes,” Maggie said. “I’ve barely touched a thing. I had big plans for the place, but I 
haven’t felt up to a big D.I.Y. project yet. I just haven’t had the energy. And there are the ghosts 
to think of. Will you look into the matter? I know it’s a strange thing to investigate, but when I 
asked around, everyone said that you’re the one to handle weird...unusual cases.”
I gritted my teeth, but nodded. I’d always been an outcast, a weirdo. Screaming about 
monsters and slipping into unwanted visions had led to a lonely childhood until I’d met Jinx.
“I’ll take the case, but I need to investigate your house, go through some of the previous 
owner’s old things,” I said.
“Of course,” she said, clutching her handbag to her chest. “Is today too soon? It’s just...I 
haven’t been sleeping. At least, I don’t remember the last time I slept.”
“No problem,” I said. “Jinx has the address?”
She nodded, and I pushed away from the desk and stood. We had an active case and I 
didn’t want to waste time, but it would be foolish to run off without a plan. My eyes flicked to 
the wall clock.
“Expect us around two o’clock,” I said. “You’re welcome to go out while we investigate. 
Just leave the door unlocked.”
That gave us over an hour to come up with a plan and stuff my pockets with weapons and 
protective charms. I’d like more time, but the woman was visibly shaken. Whatever had invaded 
her home was drawing her energy in some way. She was practically fading out of existence as 
we spoke.
“Thank you, Miss Granger,” she said, already standing and scurrying toward the door. 
“And don’t worry about me being home. I retired just before moving to Harborsmouth, and I 
hardly ever leave the house.”
 Maggie Boyd walked out onto the streets of the Old Port Quarter, and I frowned. She 
was so sickly and rail thin, I’d mistaken her for an elderly lady, but the woman was only recently 
retired and more likely in her sixties. So much for my keen observational skills.
“Buck up,” Jinx said with a wink. “So what if we have a reputation for taking on 
whacked cases? I say bring it on, the stranger the better. Weird is the new cool.”
That was easy for her to say. Jinx hadn’t seen the creatures that roamed our city, stalking 
humans as prey and ensnaring them in a deceitful web of pestilential lies and poisonous bargains.
I shrugged and opened the desk drawer where I kept my stash of hardcore protection 
charms. We were once again heading into unknown territory with no clue of what we were up 
against. Jinx could go on thinking a weird case like this was cool, but I listened to my gut, and 
right now my insides were churning into painful knots as my stomach tried to climb out my ear.
I was good at finding the truth, but I had a nagging suspicion that Maggie’s house 
wouldn’t reveal its secrets without a fight.
*****
Maggie Boyd’s new digs were in a neighborhood to the north of the Old Port Quarter, 
wedged between the slums of Joysen Hill and the gentrification of the Quarter. There was a 
lower ratio of bars to homes here, but the streets weren’t entirely residential. I would have 
missed the dead-end lane entirely if it wasn’t for the kids using the sign for target practice. Their 
ammunition was broken chunks of pavement, but I gave them a smile with too many teeth, and 
they scattered.
We made it partway down the alley before the gang tags stopped and the brick buildings 
ended, replaced by a truck graveyard on one side of the street and a weed-strewn lot on the other. 
At the end of the lane, stood a simple house that had seen better days.
The house was a basic single-story Cape with faded clapboards that might have been red 
at one time, but now gave the appearance of flaking rust. A chain-link fence and the backside of 
a warehouse rose behind the structure, leaving the house in deep shadow. The alley was also 
dark, making the yard in front of the house the only sunny spot. Weeds, grass, and tangled vines 
thrived in the patch of sunlight.
“She has her own secret garden, cool,” Jinx said with a grin.
“So did Miss Havisham,” I muttered.
I eyed our exits before approaching the house. Maggie hadn’t lived here long, but it was 
still surprising that the exterior and grounds were this rundown. If I didn’t know better, I’d have 
guessed the place abandoned for decades.
I stepped gingerly over bits of debris, boots crunching on gravel as I made my way 
slowly down the footpath. The gate was gone, rotten away or scavenged for firewood, but my 
skin tingled as I passed beyond the dilapidated wooden fence and into Maggie’s dooryard. A 
chill ran up my spine and I spun on my heel, but whatever I’d sensed, I was too late.
Jinx let out a startled cry, arms windmilling in an attempt to stay upright, but her platform 
sandals weren’t helping. She reached out a hand, and I jerked away. It was a reflex born of years 
of negative visions, but I knew I’d screwed up.
As if Jinx's look of hurt and resignation wasn't bad enough, I overcorrected and landed on 
all fours. Warm wet grass slid inside the gap between my sleeve and glove, as if the ground was 
hungrily running its many tongues along my wrist, tasting my skin.
I shuddered, yanking my hand away and rapidly climbed to my feet. I'd had a run-in with 
Hunger Grass on a previous case and it hadn’t gone well. In fact, the case had gone to Hell in a 
handbasket of woven rusty razorblades.
 I rubbed gloved hands against my pants, and shuddered. Backpedaling, I glanced left and 
right, but nobody was trying to eat our faces off. It was just Jinx and me.
“What the heck just happened?” Jinx asked, frowning. “You get a vision?”
“Not a vision,” I said, voice shaking. I swallowed hard, attention shifting to the house as I 
stepped back onto the path. “Our client ever mention an unexplained hunger or neighborhood 
pets going rabid?”
“No,” she said, brow wrinkling.
“You sure?” I asked.
“I'd have remembered pets foaming at the freaking mouth,” she said. “What gives?”
The correct question was, what takes? Hunger Grass was nasty stuff. Most people who 
step on a patch of the stuff end up changed and not for the better. First you lose your sense of 
right and wrong. Then you lose everything and everyone you ever loved.
I was immune to the stuff, but I had no idea why and even less interest in finding out. I’d 
hoped to never encounter that kind of magic again. No such luck.
“Our client has a patch of Hunger Grass in her front yard,” I said, glancing at Jinx. “You 
know what that means.”
She did. Jinx went pale, eyes widening.
“Oh shit,” she said.
Oh shit was right. Hunger Grass was extremely dangerous. Most faerie magic is. But it 
takes more than just magic to create the slavering circle of weeds.
Something bad happened here, really bad. Like famine or a hard Maine winter driving a 
family to cannibalism bad.
“You think there are actually ghosts in there?” she said. I had to hand it to my partner. 
Her face was ashen, but she didn’t run away. “The ghosts of eaten people.”
“I don’t know,” I said, squaring my shoulders. “But we're going to find out.”
 The crunch of gravel beneath my boots punctuated my words and I tried not to think 
about trudging over bones picked clean of flesh. I barely twitched when Jinx rapped on the door, 
announcing our arrival.
We didn’t have to wait long. The door swung open and Maggie stood there, eyes 
appearing sunken in the dim light. Had she touched the Hunger Grass? Was she infected with its 
magic?
“Please, come in,” she said. “I’ll be in the kitchen if you need anything. Don’t leave 
without coming back for tea. The kettle’s almost ready.”
I stepped inside the house, a polite refusal on my lips, but gasped. The shabby living 
room fell away, revealing a horror so great I was at a loss for words.
This is not at all what I expected.
“What do you see?” Jinx asked, sidling up to me as our host passed through what I 
assumed was the kitchen door. “Looks normal enough.”
“You don’t want to know,” I said, swallowing bile.
The walls were slabs of pulsating meat and the floor was sticky beneath my combat 
boots. I winced at the moist fetid air that hung heavy with the distinctive stench of a 
slaughterhouse. Fear and blood permeated every fleshy crevice, but over the underlying terror 
loomed a hunger that threatened to devour us whole.
“Jinx, go outside,” I said, voice hard.
“Outside with the creeptastic Hunger Grass?” she asked.
She had a point.
“Fine, but keep close to me,” I said, lowering my voice. “Stay away from the walls and 
don’t touch anything. Assume that nothing in this house is what it seems.”
“That’s not very reassuring,” she muttered.
“Good,” I said, palming my knife. “If you’re scared, we might just get out of this alive.”
“What about Maggie?” Jinx asked.
A tapping came from the kitchen, and I stilled. Tap, tap-tap, tap. There was an agonizing 
pause before the tapping began anew. As much as I’d love to run screaming from this bizarre 
charnel house, we had a case to solve and a client to rescue.
“We’re going to accept that cup of tea and find out what the hell is going on in this 
house,” I said.
“And if it’s a trap?” she whispered.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” I said.
I just hoped that if we did encounter a bridge, it wasn’t made of oozing muscle tissue.
On my signal, Jinx pushed open the kitchen door. At least, she swore it was a wooden 
door. If we made it out of here alive, I’d need a gallon of brain bleach to scrub that orifice from 
memory.
I gasped, staggering forward, but abruptly froze as my eyes darted back and forth from 
Maggie to the corpse wearing her clothes. Corpse might be too kind a word. The body was 
missing parts and had been gnawed on by more than rats.
That wasn’t the scariest thing in the room, not by a long shot.
I’d located the source of the tapping. Two children huddled on the floor, their knobby 
knees and the jut of their collar bones painful to witness. They leaned into each other in a one-
armed embrace, teeth chattering against a cold I couldn’t feel.
“You can see them, can’t you?” Maggie asked, voice hopeful and eyes pleading.
“She doesn’t mean the bones on the floor, does she?” Jinx whispered from where she 
stood at my back.
“No, Jinx,” I said. “But those bones are important. I’d put money on it.”
In fact, the corpse huddled around the children’s tiny forms, giving them comfort, even in 
death.
“Can you help them?” Maggie asked.
I glanced from Maggie to the body on the floor, and took a deep breath. I lifted my eyes 
to the children, turning my head to use the full strength of my second sight. The children 
flickered, but I caught a glimpse of rows of needle-like teeth, too many teeth for their gaunt 
faces.
Tap, tap-tap, tap. The chattering continued, and I winced.
“What...what did you do?” I asked.
“What any good mother would do, or so I thought,” she said. “I eased their suffering. I 
kept them alive. I didn’t know what would happen to them.”
I was going to ask what she meant, but my mind finally caught up with what my eyes 
were seeing. They didn’t have mouths ringed red and sticky from berry preserves and the 
youngest wasn’t holding a doll to her chest. The little girl stroked a clump of her mother’s hair.
“You were starving,” I said.
Maggie nodded, eyes never leaving her children.
“They were excited for the snow, at first,” she said. “It came late that year, but it more 
than made up for its tardiness. The winter was never-ending. And for them, it never will end. Not 
without your help.”
“What can I do?” I asked.
“Tell them that they are good children,” she said. “They did what they were told. They 
mustn’t suffer for my evil act.”
I frowned, but stepped forward and crouched down, careful not to touch the body at my 
feet. Being cannibalized was one vision I sure as hell didn’t want to get sucked into.
“Ivy, what are you doing?” Jinx hissed.
What was I doing? I looked at the children, using my second sight to see every detail. 
Their teeth wasn’t the only unnatural anomaly. Vein-like tendrils connected the children to the 
fleshy cabinets and gelatinous floor.
“Maggie’s children are tethered here,” I said, replying to Jinx.
I glanced up at Maggie, searching her face for clues. Her eyes were wide, but she leaned 
forward.
“Is that why they couldn’t move on?” she asked. “Can you...?”
“I’m no expert,” I said, cutting her off. “But from what I see, this house is feeding on the 
children’s suffering. If I’m right, it might not like us removing its food supply.”
“Is this a bad time to mention I’m not really dressed to battle a haunted house that feeds 
on the suffering of dead kids?” Jinx asked.
“Wishing you’d taken your chances with the Hunger Grass?” I asked.
“Hell, yes,” she said. “But you’re not leaving, are you?”
“Hell, no,” I said.
“Fine, but, for the record, I’m totally cool with you losing your weirdo street cred,” she 
said.
“What happened to the stranger the better?” I asked.
“Our client is dead, the house is alive, and there’s grass in the yard with the ability to 
create ravenous wendigos,” she said. “That’s what happened.”
I’d been watching the children while Jinx rambled. They didn’t respond to Maggie or 
Jinx, but I could have sworn their eyes slid to me more than once. Maybe my second sight 
allowed some creatures to see me more clearly.
“My name is Ivy Granger,” I said. “What’s yours?”
They didn’t reply, but both children turned their heads my way, unblinking. A low 
growling rose from their stomachs, and they stared at me with a feral gleam in their eyes. At least 
I had their attention.
Fear slithered along my spine and my glance darted around the room. Did Maggie invite 
us here to bring her children peace or dinner? I had to try to rescue the kids no matter my client’s 
motives.
“I’m a friend of your mom’s,” I said.
Walls spasmed and red tears ran in rivulets down the children’s cheeks.
“Ivy, did you feel that?” Jinx asked.
“Stay there and don’t move unless I say so,” I said.
Predators chase their prey. And these two stopped being innocent children long ago.
“Your mom is here and she loves you very much,” I said. “You’ve been very good, but 
she needs you to do one more very hard thing.”
“B-b-bad,” the boy said.
“No, you’re not,” I said.
“H-h-hungry,” the little girl moaned.
“You don’t have to ever be hungry again,” I said. “You can move on and be with your 
mom again.”
I had no idea if what I said was true, but words have a magic of their own and there were 
strong energies in this house.
I tapped into my own sense of emptiness at losing a parent, a hole in the pit of my 
stomach and an ache in my chest that would never go away. I channeled a child’s yearning for 
their parents and told the ghost children what they needed to hear.
They were good. They were loved. They were going home.
 The more I talked the more convinced I was that I could save them. And just like that, a 
door opened and the children turned to face my client.
“Mommy?”
“Take my hand,” Maggie said, reaching for her children. “We’re going home.”
The room shuddered, and Jinx lost her balance, but I kept my eyes on the children and the 
veins that tethered them to the house.
“We were bad,” the girl said.
“No, my beautiful precious boy and girl,” Maggie said. “You did exactly what your 
foolish mother asked of you. Can you forgive me?”
They ran to her, and as they reached the end of their fleshy chains, I sliced the veins with 
my blade. The knife was silver-tipped iron and sprinkled with holy water. I had no idea what the 
house was, but the veins blackened and withered, retracting with lightning speed.
Maggie mouthed “thank you” over the children’s heads and stepped through the glowing 
door.
I heard her voice through the light, calling out in a cheerful voice.
“Come on, Fluffy,” she said. “Time to go home.”
Something brushed my leg and purring filled my ears. Then it moved away and the door 
snapped shut.
My ears popped and Jinx frowned.
“Was that a cat?” she asked.
I blinked away tears.
“I don’t know, but I don’t think we’ll be getting paid for this job,” I said.
Jinx looked around the dusty kitchen and groaned. The house was once again a mundane 
structure, the only oddities were the three bodies resting in each other’s arms.
“We’re never going to see a dime,” Jinx said, staggering to the door.
The light was painfully bright, but I tilted my head to the sky and shrugged.
It’s hard to pay the bills when you’re dead. But if you die in a city filled with random 
faerie magic and have Ivy Granger on the case, you sure as Hell can settle your debts.

 <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Rain hammered the slatted wooden roof, making the most terrible racket. The well-sewn thatch seemed to keep out most of the downpour, although some drips crept into the dark corners of the hut.

Outside, through the doorless timber frame, rain could be seen splattering against the muddy ground in the patches of moonlight that broke through the thick clouds above. An ever-growing pool of water lay just beyond the building’s threshold, inching closer moment by moment. Crates and barrels were stacked high against the walls, with little room for anything else, or anyone. In what space there was, hid Driev; crouched down and rooted to the spot. He dare not move, he dare not make a sound. Despite the rain lashing down outside, he feared that any noise or movement would alert his hunters. The beasts were vicious and highly-skilled predators. If he was caught, he’d be torn apart and feasted upon. Their thick coats protected them from the harsh weather, and their carnivorous mindset meant that, despite the conditions, Driev knew they’d still be out there, in the forest, seeking him out. The vast wilderness that spread out all around him seemed to be almost swarming with them. His only hope was to sneak through and make it to the mountains, where they wouldn’t chase him.

He should move, he should go now under the cover of darkness and rain, the hunters had weak eyes after all. But he was terrified. Up in this little hut, atop a lone hill, he was vulnerable, and he knew it, but what if got lost out in the forest? What if he was seen? He could feel the fear rising within him, and desperately tried to bring his senses down to a calmer state. A blind panic was the last thing he needed. The hunters were smart, so he had to be smarter. Creeping forward, the soaking wet ground sloping beneath him, Driev peered out into the night. Visibility was dire, he could only see the ground encompassing the peak of the hilltop and a few branches of trees that were perched on its slopes. But if he couldn’t see, then neither could they. Clinging as close as he could to the wall, he snuck around the doorframe and out into the night.

Immediately, he was battered by the cold, brutal rain. He was already drenched, having been fleeing through the forest for much of the night, but it made the lashing of water no less pleasant. He dove off, down the slopes and into the woods. So dark was it that most of his movement was lead by touch alone. He reached out to feel for tree trunks, moving carefully as not to collide with bushes or low-lying shrubbery, nor crunch twigs or nuts laying on the forest floor. Driev carried on through the wilderness, slowly, as the unrelenting downpour showed no sign of reprieve. He could feel a weakness building, he was desperate to rest. He’d been hunted since dusk, and with dawn only a few hours away, had been moving non-stop for far too long. The gnawing feeling of hunger didn’t make things easier. But he had to ignore the hunger, ignore the weakness. Fight his urge to falter and trick it into thinking he was strong. He didn’t have the energy to waste on such trivialities as worry. Every move through this pitch black forest could be taking him closer to his hunters. The predators could be around any corner, any tree trunk, waiting to strike. His eyes were darting in all directions, seeking out any tiny piece of light he could find.

The darkness felt so close, so tight.

There was a constant feeling that something was behind him. About to reach and grab, pulling him down into the abyss. Occasionally he would give in to the paranoia, only to spin around to more darkness. He wanted to just run. To sprint and hide. But to give into the feeling would just make more noise; an easier target. In this nightmare, with all his senses on edge, he had to fight that feeling of adrenaline, to avoid his instinct to tear through the trees and escape as fast as possible. The occasional patch of dim moonlight breaking its way through both trees and cloud felt like sanctuary. He could at least escape the total darkness, and gain what he felt was some sort of control. Any sound — a rustle of leaves, a heavy drop of water hitting a leaf the wrong way — would cause him to jump, move forward faster or catch his breath. Driev wanted nothing more than to be out and away from here; to feel safe again. Safety though, was a long way off. Dawn would bring new challenges. Yes, he would be able to see better, and keep a lookout for his hunters instead of hoping they weren’t mere steps away, but they’d also be able to see him better. He’d have to move much more carefully through the trees. He couldn’t just make slow and steady progress like he was now. Not that he’d be able to move much faster, even if he wanted.

The cold of the night was wrapping around his core, making his movements sluggish. As time went by, and nothing leapt out of the darkness to finish him off, Driev started to feel hopeful. He might make it out after all. Then, up ahead, he saw something. The only thing he could possibly see in all this darkness: light. It wasn’t moonlight though, nor the sun creeping its way over the horizon. The light was small, flickered and clung close to the ground. A fire. At this point, anything could be there. Driev had no idea who started the fire, or if they were still there. He approached, ducking between the trees, careful not to be caught in the light of the fire.

Soon, he came to the edge of the forest, reaching a clearing. Surrounded by the wilderness was what appeared to be a burial site. Wrought-iron fence, some 10 feet high, topped with jagged spikes, encased a small selection of dirt graves, marked by stone tablets and the occasional assortment of — now drowned — flowers. A large pair of gates, chained shut but ajar, were set along the fences’ edge closest to Driev’s hiding spot. Within the burial site stood four wooden poles, half as high as the fence, topped with a large sheet tied to each one of them at the corner. Beneath the shelter was the fire, burning away, protected from the onslaught of rain. And, beside that, Driev could make out the shape of a lone hunter. The beast, keeping warm by the fireside, appeared to be fast asleep. Laying down, covered in its thick coat, it was hard to make out their size and shape, but Driev could tell it was a hunter. Dug into the ground beside it was a hand-craft metallic weapon; its two razor-sharp edges shimmering in the light of the fire. The tell-tale sign of a hunter. Rearing up on his hind legs, gripping the soggy bark of the tree in front of him with his sharp, scaled claws, Driev tried to get a better look at the vicious predator now sleeping so peacefully by the fire. They appeared to be male, adult, with a face covered in dark patches of fur. It was rare for a Lokar to get a good look at one of these hunters for so long. Most contact involved either death or fleeing from it. Slowly padding down, silently, onto all fours, Driev faced a choice. He could slip on by and into the mountains beyond, their dry, rocky peaks now becoming visible as dawn fast approached, or he could take advantage of this opportunity.

A sleeping hunter, right before him.

He could become the hunter, he had the potential to save many Lokar from a fate he nearly met that night. It was not in the nature of his kind to be violent, but it was not often you found a vulnerable predator such as this. A sharp wind whipped around the trees, rattling the chains of the gate. It startled the sleeping creature, but it soon fell back into their deep stupor. For Driev, this was the decider. If those large, metal chains didn’t wake the beast, his gentle webbed footsteps wouldn’t either. Skulking out from the trees, he edged his way forward, step by step, keeping low to the ground. His body, slippery from the torrential rain that continued its assault on the wilderness, he carefully dragged the gate open as far as the chains would allow before sliding his slender form between the gap.

He was in a cage now. Trapped with his fiercest predator. Softly, he approached the crackling fire until he hung over his prey. Gazing at the weapon momentarily, a weapon he’d seen cut down many a Lokar in the past, he considered trying to lift it, but thought better of it. He did not know how to wield it, nor if he could even lift its presumably mighty weight. Beside the beast, Driev looked small, it was longer than him by around two feet. A grunt from the creature had him stumble backwards with a jolt of fear. He couldn’t wait, he had to do it now. The cold air was slowing his body down. He wouldn’t be able to escape or fight back if they woke. Back up beside the hunter, he gripped his claws tightly together, so the points of his talons created a sharp trio of what he hoped would be a fearsome weapon. If he could crush the shell of the toughest beetle, surely this would work?

As quickly as he could, Driev raised up on his back legs, claw high, then slammed down towards the ground, driving his talons into the beast’s exposed neck. With a squirt of blood and a desperate attempt to inhale through its now carved up throat, the hunter lurched up. In a flight of terror, it tried helplessly to breathe through the hole in his neck, as Driev withdrew quickly, slinking back out the burial site before the creature could react to him. He watched, from behind the gate, as the hunter grasped at his wound, blood coating his hands and chest, trying to drag in deep, dry breaths to no effect. Within moments, it crumpled into a heap, still and lifeless.

Elated by a sense of accomplishment, Driev once again made for the mountains beyond the forest, making quicker progress in the light of dawn; his new-found confidence allowing him to move more recklessly than he perhaps should. The fish had just slain the shark, and he couldn’t wait to let the others know. It was unheard of, for a monster such as the hunter to be struck down by one of his kind. In their history, he’d never heard of anything like it. But then, he thought, the hunters were ruthless and relentless, now.

Had he just shown them the Lokar were something to be feared and left alone, or a threat that needed to be taken care of? Fear unlike anything he’d ever experienced, not even while being hunted down in the dead of night for his own meat, gripped him. Would the beasts see that it was their own acts that led to such violence, or would they see it as an act of war? New and previously unseen aggression. The prospect of their wrath was without equal. Their weapons, tools, intellect and numbers made them an impossible foe to match. As Driev finally reached the safety of the warm mountains and sanctuary he had craved all night, his heart was heavier than ever. Should he tell the others? And if so, should he be bragging of his conquest, or warning them of impending catastrophe?  <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Once again, Kiara sat on the end of her rustic four poster bed, its frame draped with luxurious cloths of dazzlingly white silk. The bed itself lay messy, the pillows heaved over each other in a crumpled mess. The duvet was slung off the foot of the bed, dangling over its edge and resting on the polished hardwood floor beneath.

She didn’t how many times she’d sat there, clothes falling limply around her slender form, as she tenderly kissed her latest lover goodbye before watching them leave, cursing them and counting their money the second they were out of sight. Her bright smile quickly turning to a curled and crooked lip. Kiara often wondered who she hated more: the men or herself. But it was always the same conclusion. It was always them.

Sighing, she looked to distract her mind. Gazing down at the palm of her hand, Kiara slowly wriggled her fingers, taking in a deep breath. Something started to spark between them, as if the flow of air between her fingers was creating some sort of unseen friction. The sparks grew bigger, until a flame emerged; a slither of fire that Kiara absent-mindedly twirled between her knuckles.

There was a knock at the door.

In a lurch of panic, Kiara quickly clenched her fist, extinguishing the flame. The knock came from Verva, the owner of the establishment in which Kiara worked. She never waited for an answer and a moment later, her head was around the door, smiling pleasantly.

What did she want?

“Good work this morning, my girl. It’s quiet downstairs now, the parade is starting. Why don’t you go down and see if you can drum up some business for later?”

Kiara said nothing, she just nodded. Verva had learnt to accept no more than this and skulked out, closing the door behind her. Kiara took another soothing breath, lifting her nose to the ceiling, she tried to quell her inner anguish. If there was one thing she hated more than letting men do what they did, it was going into town to convince them to do it.

Heaving herself up, her body clearly rejecting her mind’s purpose, not wanting to leave the solitude of her room, she headed for the door.

Kiara emerged from what she not so fondly referred to as her carefully disguised prison, into a lurid courtyard of redstone walls; walls covered in climbing flowers that wove their way amongst the wooden slatted windows and two-story terraces that sprawled across this affluent corner of the city. The sun-soaked shrine in the centre, a bronze statue of some old dead hero, shimmered in the light. Kiara sneered as she passed the metallic monstrosity. Every time she saw it there, she wondered why nobody else seemed to spot the vulgarity beneath. A hero of the people, standing guard outside a house of pleasure, corruption and despair.

Against the wall of the brothel, Kiara spotted a fellow worker, head between her knees, weeping. Some girls couldn’t handle the life they were forced into. Kiara didn’t pause to comfort her, she wasn’t interested in more tedium than she was already subjected to today.

The heat of the high-noon sun pummelled the sandstone paving along which Kiera wandered, bringing beads of sweat to her forehead. Why they called this city Coldmore she’d never know. Eight years she’d lived here, and it was never cold. She’d always thought to ask about the name, but dreaded the idea of an answer longer than a sentence or two.

People liked to talk too much.

This district of the city rose high with more two-story redstone houses. Narrow and constantly splitting off in new directions, the streets were like a maze. You could easily get lost here, easily lose an afternoon, but Kiara didn’t care. It was quiet here. Just how she liked it. A moment’s peace. Time without a man in her ear. It was remarkable, Kiara mused to herself as she made her way further down the streets towards a growing sound of cheers and screams somewhere beyond the maze of houses, that despite being told hour after hour how beautiful she was, she felt anything but.

Not that their opinions would mean much to her under a different circumstance anyway. Kiara had little interest in what most people had to say.

The noise of the crowd grew louder as she took a right down another, near identical street. The shutters of the houses were all thrown open in the warmth of summer. Beautiful potted flowers were placed precariously on window ledges; items of clothing hanging out to dry overhead. There was little fear of crime here, not in this part of the city. The few people she passed were the epitome of wealth. Wearing colourful clothes, neat and well looked after, adorned with jewels that sparkled in the sunlight. Kiara often had to remind herself that this is what she, herself, looked like. As she passed a couple, arm-in-arm, she got exactly what she’d come to expect from the people here. A reserved smile, a nod and a swift look past her. She didn’t much care for the people here. Although truth be told, she didn’t much care for people anywhere.

Finally, she reached the parade. The noise of the crowd was nearly deafening. Loud, unseen drummers played in rhythm to screeches and cheers of hundreds of onlookers. Ducking around a corner, behind the crowds, Kiara took yet another breath, pulled on a fake smile and streaked out into the herded masses.

Immediately she spotted a former patron, a portly man with a ragged beard, stained clothes and deep pockets. He didn’t much care to look after himself; he let others do that for him. Kiara was on him in moments, draping her fingers softly over his left shoulder before curling around his waist.

“We’ve missed you, Clark.”

Clark couldn’t have looked more pleased to see her. He ran his hands down her arm, looking at her from head to toe.

“It has been…’ Clark grumbled with grim, pleasureful sound, ‘A while.”

“Come and visit me soon.” Kiara winked, getting closer. She pressed her body against his, arms around his waist, resting her chin on his chest and looking up at him with big, dazzling eyes. “Please”.

Clark grinned, food caught between his yellow and black teeth, nodding furiously.

“Good.”

Kiara slunk off his form and turned away. The second her eyes no longer met his, they dropped from dazzling to dull.

Kiara continued to slide across the back of the crowds that lined a wide and open high street. She could hear the clinking of metal and the marching of steel booted soldiers as they made their way through the gathered spectators. Thanks to her short stature, though, she couldn’t hope to see over the much taller men, woman and even large children all clammering to get a look. But she wasn’t after a look anyway. She found the annual parade to be rather harrowing. People once free, sworn into lifelong servitude of a god they’d never seen, wheeled up and down in front of the people like cattle at a market. She might spend her day in the service of others, but at least she could enjoy some of life’s more solitary treasures when her work was done; like walking down a busy street without being gawked at.

She carried on, eyeing the crowd for stray men. Men she knew, men she liked the look of or just men that had wandered too far from their wives. But her eye was caught by none of these, instead, it was caught by a city guard leaning up against the wall of a house that cornered yet another winding alley. The city guard was short and slim, with rough blonde hair, soft features and clad in exotic metal plate work. He watched the crowd keenly.

“Should you not be in the parade?” Kiara called out as she approached him, grabbing his attention.

“Somebody’s got to keep an eye out for the unpleasant sort”. The city guard gave Kiara a look up and down, but not like Clark. This was a look of disdain. Of disapproval.

“Lucky we don’t get many of those around here,” Kiara said, smiling innocently and taking up a leaning stance beside him. “Warm today isn’t it?”

The guard mumbled back agreeingly, clearly not looking to strike up any sort of conversation.

“Must be hot in that armour,” Kiara continued. She leaned in close, took the guard by the arm and whispered silkily in his ear. “Maybe you should let me take it off and cool you down.”

The guard snapped a look at her. They were nose to nose. A fiendish smile on her face, a bitter look on his. He gave her a cold, penetrating stare before pushing her away forcefully. She shook her head with a fluttering laugh, a smile still spread across her face — a contrast to the anger she felt inside.

How dare he?

Kiara had gotten very, very good at hiding her true emotions. She wouldn’t get much business if she couldn’t. But she always struggled to maintain her mask when they knocked her around.

Her anger was diffused as her attention was drawn to the parade. The cheers of the crowd were getting louder. Excitement was filling the air. Kiara’s eyes fell on a trio of women, standing waist-high above the crowd, in the centre of the parade route. They appeared to be almost gliding over the heads of onlookers. A smooth grey mane and delicately pointed ears crept their way above the rows of people, bobbing up and down as they went. The horse soured the illusion for Kiara. Ahead of the trio, the large silver-maned mare pulled their carriage along slowly, so that everyone could get a good look.

The women wore bright red robes, glittering with golden embroidery. Their hair was tied up high in elaborate plaits and knots. Each looking nearly identical. What stood out most about these women though, was the fire. As they moved through the crowd, jets of flame shot from their hands, wrapping around their forearms as they swayed to the beat of the drums. As the women got even closer, the noise became unbearable. The people on the streets were enthralled by the magic, soaking up every moment of it like it was their last. Kiara had seen foreign Kings and Queens move through the very same streets without anything close to as much fanfare. Nobody was as loved and adored in the city of Coldmore than those who possessed the flame. The trio continued to display their gifts as the carriage rolled on past Kiara, shooting flames into the air and twisting them around each other in a fiery dance. It was hypnotic, in a strange sort of way.

Kiara looked at her hands, then back to the women. She pictured herself up there. In a soft red dress with people screaming and pushing just to get a look at her. She imagined going back to the palace where the magic users lived. Being adored, being loved… being imprisoned by her gift until she died. Property of the city. Property of the people. Never leaving without a host of guards large enough to conquer a nation. Never being left alone. The only freedom in sight being her last breath, brought quicker by the knife to the wrist she’d be tempted by every single day.

Kiara turned away and moved on. She returned to her hunt for patrons, finding great success with those men entranced by the beauties of magic; beauties they knew they could never hope to have. At least they could lay with another beauty, which might just be enough, for now. By the time the crowds of the parade started to disperse she had convinced more than a few to visit her before the week was out. She liked to think she was good at manipulating people, but maybe they were just that desperate.

A slow wander back through the streets was made especially slow by the crowds returning home, all elated by the magic they had just witnessed. Kiara didn’t mind the pace. If she’d done her job properly, she’d have a couple men waiting for her when she got back. A busy afternoon was good for the pocket, but bad for the soul. But a soul didn’t feed her or keep her warm on those brisk city nights. Still, she found herself taking a few accidental wrong turns down some much quieter alleys. Soon, she found herself in perhaps her favourite place in the entire city.

It was an open-air garden; green, luscious and just a little bit overgrown. In the middle was a small and shallow stone pool that people would occasionally come to cool their feet in, especially on hot days. Visitors to the garden were few and far between though, most prefered the larger gardens and parks away from the suburban streets, and as usual, it was empty. Seclusion was hard to come by in Coldmore, but here Kiara felt cut off from the world. With enough room for only a few people to stand inside, and completely enclosed by the windowless walls of houses, reachable only by a narrow archway that adorned the entrance, it wasn’t a well-known spot within the city walls. A single stone bench lay hidden in a small nook, sat up against the wall left of the entrance, ivy encroaching on its corners and climbing up over the lip of the flat-roofed building above.

Kiara dipped a toe into the pool, dampening her sandals, before settling on the bench. She sat, in a daze, willing the sun to set. The more she thought about it, the less she wanted to go back. Another man, then another. The thought made her skin crawl. She could just end it all. Show the world her flames and become adored by the people. Live a life of servitude she could never escape. She was given the opportunity of two worlds, and she hated them both. But at least, maybe one day, she could escape this one. She didn’t see how. There wasn’t much opportunity for a woman without a husband in Coldmore, and the only thing she hated more than the idea of being a servant to the city was a servant to one person. Reliant on them. A possession of theirs to be flaunted or hidden whenever they chose.

She let a small flame flicker in her hand. So many choices, yet no choices at all. Clapping her hands together she extinguished it angrily. Maybe no choice would be better than having a choice. But her mind couldn’t ponder on such thoughts. Unbeknownst to her, wrapped up in her own little world, a visitor had encroached on her space; given away by the clinking of his metal boots. The city guard was standing in the archway, watching her. How he’d snuck up on her Kiara did not know. It didn’t really matter, his eyes were lit like the flame she had just extinguished. She looked back at him in horror.

“What are you doing here?” She whispered, her voice cracking slightly.

“I followed you. I thought you  might— you know, pickpockets and— make trouble—and”. The guard tried to keep his nerve but couldn’t find his words. What he has just witnessed echoed in his voice. His eyes were fixed on Kiara’s hand.

A comment like that was not something Kiara would normally let slide, she hated being called a thief. Judgement was all too common in this city, and she made certain those who did regretted it.

She was a whore, not a criminal.

For years now, it was the only time she’d let even the smallest part of her mask fall down. But, her mind couldn’t go to that place of anger, it was still wrapped in the moment she was experiencing. For the first time in a long time, she didn’t just let her mask fall down, she wore no mask at all.  

“What are you going to do?” She asked firmly.

“What do you mean?”

“Are you not going to run to the palace and proclaim to have found another gifted girl?” Kiara spoke with an air of disgust.  

“Why haven’t you already done that?”

“Not all of us were born for that life.” Kiara glared at the city guard, her worry mixing with a burning anger, but the anger wasn’t directed at him. How could she have been so careless? So stupid?

“You prefer to entertain the dregs of humanity in your seedy den than serve in the flame?”. The guard asked, raising an eyebrow. Of course to him, the notion seemed ridiculous.

“Yes, I do.,” Kiara replied curtly.

“Then go.” With that, the city guard stood aside, opening the archway. In silence, he gestured for Kiara to leave.

She was startled by the offer, and rose from her seat apprehensively. She just wanted to run, to escape a moment she hoped never to experience, but this had to be a trick. Her mind was all over the place. She needed to think, to find an answer, but she couldn’t. She’d never felt anything like this before. Not once, in over two decades of life, had she ever been afraid like she was right now.

As she moved to pass him, she looked up at the guard, eyes wide.  

“What do you want from me?” She was almost pleading with him. Usually, the intentions of the men in front of her were clear, but she couldn’t understand why he was letting her go. It was a strange feeling, to not be playing a game with the man she locked eyes with.

“I will find you.” The guard whispered softly as he leant in towards her ear. His words weren’t threatening. “I serve the flame. You are one with the flame. I will help you see where you belong.”

“Or I will help you see what the flame really is. Just another cage I’m trapped inside.”

 

Rays of sun spun their way angelically through Kiara’s window as her busy afternoon finally drew to a close. She carefully picked up her bed linens and pillows, heaping them together. Pulling her door to, she slung them out into the corridor. Somebody else’s problem now.

In the corner of the room was a dresser. Oak, beautifully carved, and so tall it nearly scraped the ceiling. The dresser stood at an awkward angle, crossing it diagonally with its back corners resting against the walls on either side of it, while both of the front corners stuck out into the room. With difficulty, Kiara heaved the dresser to one side, the mighty piece of furniture groaning as it was slowly dragged across the wooden floor. Behind the dresser was a chair. A small and simple wooden frame, with quilted arms, back and seat. It was the only piece of furniture in the room that was untainted. She placed the chair before her lone window. Sitting down, she bathed herself in the sun’s warmth, spreading her arms out so it touched every inch of skin it could. This was her one pleasure in life, that and her secluded garden. Before her mind could be drawn to her worries, there was a knock at the door. She didn’t move, or say anything, she just waited for Verva to enter.

“Something wrong my dear?” Verva said, almost convincing Kiara she was genuinely concerned. Almost.

“No.” Kiara shut her eyes, staying rooted to her chair. She didn’t give Verva so much as a glance.

“Some of the patrons, they were… worried about you. Said you seemed distracted”.

“Sorry Verva, I was just feeling a bit tired this afternoon. The heat. I’ll be back on form tomorrow, I promise”.

“Okay dear”. Her voice was warm, but there was an undercurrent to Verva’s words that Kiara knew all too well. She didn’t run the most successful brothel in Coldmore by letting her girls lose their edge. “Anyway, you have a guest”.

This got Kiara’s attention. She looked at Verva, dismayed. “But I filled my quota”.

Her voice sounded desperate.

“He’s not a patron”. Verva backed away from the door as the city guard entered. He didn’t wear his illustrious armour anymore, but was instead in plain clothing, with sandals laced above the shin and leather bands around his wrist.

Kiara sat up straight in her chair, watching him curiously as he shut the door behind him.

“Didn’t take you long”.

“I just wanted to talk.” the guard said softly, his voice calming. Slowly, he approached Kiara, perching on the window ledge through which the sunlight poured, blocking it from view. She scowled at him through narrow eyes, but said nothing.

The guard looked at her with an affectionate smile, Kiara knew why.

“Preach, then”. She barked begrudgingly, settling back in her chair.

The guard wasted no time.

“The flame is a gift from God, urrr…”

“Kiara”

“Kiara. Each and every one of us is in servitude to it, we owe what we have to the flame. It is the greatest honour to serve the flame.”

“I’ve lived here many years,” Kiara said, rolling her hand in a gesture to the guard. She didn’t know his name either.

“Kor.”

“Kor. I know about the servitude, I know about the sacred vows and promises you members of the palace guard make, but I… I don’t want to be forever in servitude. What you people do… it makes me feel ill.”

Kor looked at Kiara earnestly, brushing off her comments without a second thought. She got the feeling not a single word out of her mouth would upset him. His starry eyes said it all; devotion. She was no longer a person to him. She was as close to a deity as he could get.

“Do you know what we of the flame believe?”

“Yes,” Kiara replied, dully, blinking back at him.

“Her power passes through you, Kiara. You, like those at the parade today, are conduits of her fire. Her gifts to the world.”

Kiara sat, pretending to contemplate his words. In reality, she was bored. She, like everyone else, had listened to crackpots preach about the flame for as long as she can remember. She never felt she was channelling God, never heard whispers or had thoughts of divine providence. She could just start a fire without flint and tinder. But then, she realised, this man didn’t believe that. But he did believe in his own ridiculous rhetoric.

An idea sparked in her mind.

“What if my destiny lies elsewhere? What if I felt a call, but it wasn’t to serve the city, but for something—” Kiara chose her words carefully. “Greater”.

She was back into her act, her mask in full view. She tucked in her shoulders and head to make herself seem vulnerable. Her eyes grew wider, more innocent and naive — anything she couldn’t say with words, she could say with a look.

“How do you mean?” Kor appeared unsettled.

“I always felt like my gift was a not meant for me, because I never wanted to belong to the palace. But what if it is because she is guiding me elsewhere? I’ve always felt a pull, ever since I was a little girl growing up in the city. A pull beyond these walls. Like she’s telling me to follow a different path”.

After a moment of gazing out the window, deep in thought, Kor’s eyes fell back to Kiara. “You are her voice”. He said quietly, in agreement.

“Yes!” Kiara stood quickly, moving towards Kor. Placing her hand softly on his face, she stroked her thumb across his stubbled cheek. Kor locked eyes with her, mesmerised by the woman that stood before him. Kiara too, had what can only be described as an affectionate look in her eye; far from the cunning thoughts that now ran through her mind. “And I don’t think I knew, until I met you, what I have to do.”

“What do you have to do?” Kor’s voice was weak and small, taken in by her sudden show of affection. His eyes drawn to the thumb that now caressed his cheek.

“We have to leave this place, together.”

Kor took in a deep breath, the words that followed filled with great regret “I can’t, I’m sworn to the city, to the flame, to her…”

“I am her. You said it yourself. You are sworn to me.”

“If I leave, they’ll come after me. They’ll hang me for betraying my promise to serve until—”

Kiara pressed her fingers against his lips, quelling his chatter. She attempted to look like she was being understanding, or at least that she is thinking over his words. She was not really sure what expression she wore, her mind was too busy turning over and over, trying to think of what to say next.

“Do you know what happens to me in here? Your conduit of God.” Kiara pretended to angrily remove her hand from Kor’s cheek.

A great sadness filled Kor’s eyes. He nodded.

“Take me away from here, take me from my prison and help me follow the fire that guides me. That guides us.” She put her hand to his chest. “Do you not think we met for a reason?”

Kor fidgeted on the spot. It seemed as if he was desperately searching for words as well. His mouth opening and closing, about to say something, until he finally came out with “We could tell the others, they might understand if we tell them”.

“And what if they don’t? What if they force me into the palace? We may never find out what she is really guiding me to.”

Kor was becoming flustered. His mind was in overdrive, she could tell by the flickering of his eyes and his incessant blinking.

“So what would we do, if we leave?”  

Suddenly, Kiara was caught off guard. What if they did leave? She hadn’t thought that far ahead. Would she end up his pet as he worked, or back in a whorehouse halfway around the world? They would have to remain hidden because of his stupid vows. She could leave him, but where would she go? If she had options, she’d have already fled. She thought he was her prison key, but yet another awaited her. Her spark of an idea was now a very small flame. If she didn’t play things right, it could easily be extinguished.

“We’d have to.” Her mind was blank. “We’ll have to…”

“We would need a plan,” Kor said, saving her from her bumbling. “A way to survive beyond Coldmore. A way to follow the fire that guides you”.

Time to think, that was what she needed. Maybe Kor was not the key, but perhaps he could bring it to her, like a well-trained dog.

“Yes.” She smiled. “Together, we can find a way to follow the path.”

“By her grace, we live.“ Kor chanted, closing his eyes and looking to the ground in prayer.

Kiara got in a swift eye roll before he looked back up to her, that same sickness of devotion still washed across his face. A look that she has seen on countless faces at the parade earlier that day. He smiled back at her faintly and gave a slight bow, like the good little soldier he was, before turning to leave. Just as he reached the door, he looked back at her.

“Could I see it again?” He asked sheepishly.

Kiara gave him a crooked smile as she dashed over to him. She placed her hand on his right shoulder and moved in close, her lips against his ear. She then lifted her left hand, lit a fire on her fingertips and spun it around right before his eyes. As he watched the fire, she kissed him on the cheek and whispered in his ear “don’t tell a soul.”

Stepping back slowly, she gave him with a deep, vulnerable, tender look; a look she gave all her best paying and least detestable patrons. The ones that always came back for more. She knew how to fake just about anything, even love.

“Nobody has ever seen the real me before.”

A statement that was still very much true.

 

 

Kor visited Kiara often from that day onwards. The second night, he bought two wooden sparring swords, passing their meetings off as training sessions paid for by Kiara, to help protect herself against rowdy customers. Those that served the palace could not own personal wealth, nor lay with whores, but they needed an excuse to meet. Kiara was forced to donate wages to the poor house on the other side of the city in return for Kor’s time, much to her disdain — or delight, as she made sure Kor thought.

With their romantic little cover story, as Kiara put it, they had all the time they needed now to plan. Well, Kiara would attempt to plan as Kor denied her at every opportunity, calling her ideas nothing short of unrealistic or foolhardy. Kiara had to admit, the excitement of a chance to escape her prison drove her mad with creative ideas. She also had no idea what they would do. She knew they needed money, and lots of it, but no idea how to get it. She had to figure out how she could use Kor for something. He must have a use.

She would lie awake, going over potential move after potential move. She dreamed of one thing: freedom, and sunshine, maybe by the coast. No man to care for, no man to please. Nothing but herself and the power to do what she wanted. She’d always thought of her magic as a curse, but maybe it was a gift after all.

Maybe it could take her away and give her what she always wanted.  

Kor’s affections for Kiara grew rapidly, and she was all too aware. But this is exactly what she wanted. She greeted him like a long-lost lover every time he came through the door and spent her time with the guard perched on his lap, talking to him softly and whispering sweetly into his ear. After a few days, she got even closer. After a well-orchestrated and tender moment, where she revealed she’d nearly had her head lopped off by bandits while travelling as a girl, she leant in and kissed him, gently at first, then with a fervent passion. Kor, like the good little follower of the palace that he was, tried to resist, to keep his vows, but it did not take long before he relented. Kiara was far too good at being something worth getting close to. Sometimes she worried he’d see through it all, but every day he came back to help her, oblivious.

Soon, now completely besotted, Kor took to visiting her at all hours, whenever he could. She almost felt bad, knowing he could be outside the window, listening while she was with a customer. She worried he might do something rash and impulsive, as fools in love did, and ruin her plans. She warned him not to come by before sunset, but he never listened. Happily, these visits were fleeting and, more importantly, calm. He would stride in, covered in gleaming steel armour, feigning some city business like noise complaints or patrols, but not once in her eight years here had a city guard entered Verva’s brothel, yet here one stood every other morning. It wasn’t as subtle as he hoped. Verva didn’t mind though, not as long as Kiara kept the customers happy.

Kiara had seen this behaviour before, in clients that didn’t quite understand the difference between love and paid love. Except this time no money was involved, so poor Kor was not to know his love was a lie. All he wanted to do was see her. It was tragic, in a useful sort of way.

Kiara had one final goal, to bed the city guard. Worried he might leave, become disheartened or eventually figure out her game, she knew that getting him between her sheets would break a vow so precious that to disobey it meant death. She couldn’t think of better leverage. Kiara was now intentionally creating evermore ridiculous plans, plans she knew were wild and impossible to pull off. She spoke of faked deaths, of kidnapping and even thievery from the palace itself. She wanted to make this whole idea seem almost delusional. A tragic and unconquerable quest that gifted them a bond of true love. She wanted to disconnect him from the outside, to make him feel as if they only had each other. As if all other forces were working against them. This vow was the final chain in the link she needed to break. And this was the way to crack it.

It took time before she finally caught him off guard. It started innocently enough, with another inane idea. This time, she got him into her bed, complaining of a sore stomach and chill. It was warm out, it always was, but she wanted him close — closer than ever before. As they lay, entwined in her bed, she spoke of life beyond the city together. Of days spent under the shade of a tree or listening to the chorus of gulls by the water’s edge. She threw in some religious bullshit about the flame and a flash of her fire for good measure. She was impressed really, no man had ever resisted her this long, but then no man faced death if they fell for her seduction. Except maybe if their wives found out. Even Kor, though, was no match for Kiara in the end.

She was just too dangerous of a player.

When he left, she didn’t feel that usual hatred. She sat perched where she always did, watching as the door closed. She didn’t feel joy, or happiness either, something the look on his face told her that Kor clearly did. Instead, Kiara felt accomplished. She’d done what she set out to do. But she also felt something else. She’d never tolerated a man like she tolerated Kor. The feel of his skin against hers didn’t make it crawl. The feel of his breath on her neck didn’t make her shudder. Maybe this was love.

Exactly thirty-three days after she met Kor, her prayers were realised.

 

 

A cool breeze whipped the air as Kiara wandered through the alleys in the early morning. The only ones awake beside her were market stall owners, trundling down the stone streets with carts laden with wares, ready for a busy day of selling useless trash nobody wanted. A polite smile and nod were all they would get out of Kiara. She never used to wake this early, but it was a common occurrence these days. Her mind was so full of thoughts that the moment she woke she was alive with a fire that burned brighter than the one that flowed through her fingertips.  

Kiara entered her favourite little garden, her piece of heaven in amongst the overshadowing city streets. She dipped her feet into the cold water and sat back down on the bench where Kor had first found her. This was a fond moment for her. She didn’t much care for memories, but she liked this one. The moment she found hope. It wasn’t fond memories that brought her to the garden this early though, nor her wandering mind.

The clinking sound of metal plates rattling against each other alerted her to Kor’s arrival. He stood in the entrance to the garden. Kiara drew a stone from her pocket and smirked. Carved into the rough surface were the words garden and sunrise.

“Didn’t you get enough of me last night?”

Kor was not wearing his usual expression of love and devotion, Instead, it was sullen and wrapped with anxiety. He seemed restless, tapping his fingers and looking over his shoulder.

“What is wrong?” Kiara patted the seat next to her. Kor shook his head at the invitation. A jolt of nerves hit Kiara with a sensation she felt only being penetrated with an arrow could mimic. Had he caught her out?

“I can’t stay,” Kor said quickly, with another look over his shoulder.

Usually Kor was a man of few words, Kiara liked this about him, but she wasn’t looking for curt sentences today. Not as beads of sweat began to form on the back of her neck.

“Tell me.” Kiara rose quickly and almost glided over to Kor, her long flowing dress grazing the grass that crept its way through the sandstone tiled floor. She got closer to him, testing to see how he reacted. He didn’t move in to meet her, but didn’t pull away either.

Kiara waited on his next move. She didn’t like this; not being able to read somebody.

“I have a way out for us.”

Kiara stifled a sigh of relief and instead looked at her lover with eager eyes. As much as she wanted to probe, she knew that wasn’t the way to play this one.

“Then why are you sad?” She offered, feigning concern as best she could.

“I’m not sad. I’m worried.” Kor locked eyes with Kiara, holding a stern gaze. She could see it in him, something was wrong.

“If it’s dangerous, we’ll find another way.” She couldn’t risk losing him, not yet.

“It’s not dangerous, and that’s what worries me.”

“What is going on, Kor? Talk to me.”

Kor pulled Kiara in close to him, not romantically but to make sure nobody could hear his words. “You mentioned two nights ago, stealing from the palace. I can do it.”

“What?” Kiara gasped. Her plan was a joke, a ploy to keep him in her bedroom longer.

“The palace army is marching out of Coldmore as we speak, with most of the city guard. Only a few of us will remain. I can take a few jewels and we can leave. It will take days before they realise they’re gone. We’ll find a buyer far from here and escape. Then we can do whatever you need to follow the fire inside you.”

Kiara was feeling emotions she’d never felt before. She wasn’t prone to happiness or elation quite like this. The closest she came to joy was her evening sunset, and even then that was more about letting go of the day than anything else. Before she let herself be swept up in the moment, she remembered that the man before her was worried about something. She had to remember she was supposed to care as to why.

“That’s amazing, my love. But what burdens you?”

“It’s not right. Coldmore doesn’t go to war. We don’t march outside the walls. We haven’t for a hundred years. The city has never been this empty. I shouldn’t be able to just steal from the palace and have things go unnoticed. Something feels very wrong”.

“It is not your job to worry about war and politics. You’re a servant of the flame, so help me serve her.”

Her words didn’t seem to ease Kor’s concern. She pushed further.

“This could be part of her divine will. To help us escape. To give us a chance. To let us realise whatever purpose drives me.”

Kor pursed his lips. Kiara could see it in him. He wanted to believe her words, but he was too much of a stubborn soldier to give up his fear. It mattered very little though, his mind seemed made up.

“We leave tonight, when my watch ends. It will give us at the very least until morning before they notice I’ve gone, much longer for the jewels. Gather enough supplies for five days on the road and meet me at the stables by the southern gate at sunset.”

And with that, Kor was gone, swept away in uncharacteristic fashion. His unusual behaviour didn’t quite resonate with Kiara as perhaps it should. She was too gleeful to be worried, although she knew she ought to be. Tonight she’d leave her prison and be free, if all went to plan. She’d always known she didn’t want life within these city walls, but she never knew of the freedom she could actually have, not until she met Kor.

It was all within her grasp.

 

 

It was after midday when the horn blew. Kiara had just finished entertaining her fourth client of the day, clients who were receiving a service above and beyond the norm — Kiara just couldn’t contain her excitement.

She peered out of her open shutters and down the streets in search of the source of the noise. People were running through the alleys, looking nervous; almost fleeing. Many were ushered inside houses and doors slammed. Then the horn blew again. She had no idea what it meant. Without a knock, Verva flung the door open, crashing through it so hard it nearly snapped off the hinges. The brothel owner was frantic. In a panic. She spoke a few words and disappeared in an instant. Her face was red and awash with sweat.

“The city is under attack, hide.”

Kiara looked back out the window. She could see now, the fear on people’s faces. She started to notice the terror in their eyes and the panic in their movements as they moved through the alley below her window. Rushing to her dresser, she dragged open the top drawer and pulled a knife from within it, which she promptly tucked into an open seam in her dress. Ducking under her bed, Kiara removed three planks of wood to reveal a crawl space just big enough for her. All the rooms in the brothel had one. You could never be too careful in this line of work. She tucked herself inside and lay there as time ticked on. For quite a while, she heard little but muffled voices and rushing around outside.

Kiara didn’t really feel terror. It wasn’t an emotion that came naturally to her, but she was worried. Worried about how this would affect her plans. What if there was an attack, and what if Kor was slain before getting her the jewels? In the darkness, trapped beneath flooring and between structural beams, a place even Kiara found the be slightly claustrophobic, it got even quieter. She started to wonder if it was all a false alarm. The horns had stopped. There was nothing but silence beyond her window.

Just as she started to wonder about creeping out from within her crawl space and sneaking a look outside, the screams started. Screams of women pierced the streets and found their way into her little hideaway. It was hard to make out the other sounds. Clashing metal, men roaring and knocking that sounded like doors being cracked open. While inside the brothel remained quiet, through her window she could hear a cacophony of chaos.

Coldmore was a peaceful city, a place that hadn’t seen conflict in centuries. Whatever brutality unfolded beyond her bedroom, Kiara knew it was not what the people deserved. She wasn’t really saddened by it, but she knew there would be in no justice in what sounded to be the most painful of deaths.

As Kiara’s mind wandered back to how this would affect her escape that evening, something entered her room with a thud. Through a crack in the floorboard, she could see that the door hadn’t opened. They must have entered through the open window.

On the second floor?

Somebody was definitely walking around inside, the clinking of heavy metal boots gave them away.

“Kor?”

Kiera’s heart fluttered. He wasn’t dead. They could still make it work. Throwing off the panels, Kiara emerged from beneath her bed. Before she could stand, Kor gripped her tightly, damn-near crushing her up against his uncomfortable armour plate.

“I thought I’d lost you,” Kor said, his voice quaking.

“I’m fine, I’m fine,” Kiara said, patting him down to look for the jewels, hoping it looked like she was checking for wounds. She tried to seem scared, she nearly forgot that she should be. Her movements were jagged, very jagged. Was she overacting? Before she could finish her search, Kor grasped her by the chin and kissed her.

“We need to go now,” Kor said, releasing her. “We’ll take the rooftops, I know a safe way out.”

“Have you got the jewels?” Kiara didn’t care how it sounded, she needed to know.

“No,” Kor said with a frantic look over his shoulder, marching to the window and checking each side of the alley. “I was trying to take them, as the alarm rang. They caught me, Kiara. They came rushing for me, and the others saw me.”

It was all Kiara could do not to slap the incompetent fool.

“But without them, what will we have?”

Kor squared up to Kiara, looked her dead in the eye and said calmly “We have your flame, we have each other, we have our love”.

Her heart sank. No jewels, no freedom. Her dreams shattered with Kor’s words. It was over, but she couldn’t leave.

“We should stay and hide. It’s too dangerous out there.”

“I won’t survive this Kiara, not if I stay. If I don’t die in the attack, I’ll be hung for trying to steal palace property. I know a way out, but we have to move before it’s closed. It’s the perfect cover. We escape, then the army returns. They’ll think I died fighting. They won’t ever look for us.”

Kiara released him with a long and obvious groan. For the first time, she revealed her true face. She gazed at him dully, her affection and passion replaced not with disdain or anger but with simple annoyance. She could no longer hide what she felt, and why should she? Kor looked back at her, perplexed by the expression that greeted him. He had only ever seen a kind, gentle, vulnerable face gazing back at him. This sudden move jarred him, he seemed lost. As unseen, but strongly heard, violence erupted in the streets, Kiara was aware she had given herself away. But she didn’t care. Kor was not only useless to her now, but he was a liability. He couldn’t be trusted outside the city alone, and what might he say so his life would be spared?

“They’ll think you died fighting.” Kiara commented, musing on Kor’s works. There wasn’t a hint of emotion in her voice.

“Kiara?” Kor uttered, his singular word riddled with confusion.

“Why do they call it Coldmore?” She asked. “It’s never cold…”

Swiftly, without hesitation, she pulled the knife from beneath her dress and rammed it into Kor’s neck. With a soundless gasp, his knees buckled and he dropped onto the hardwood floor. He reached up weakly and tried to grapple with the handle of the blade, his hands slipping across its slender form as they became coated in blood. His panicked, desperate eyes fell up to Kiara, who stood over him, watching calmly.

She gave him a small, warm and genuine smile. “You did die fighting. Fighting for my freedom”.

“My love?” Kors choked words were hard to make out.

She didn’t respond, instead simply watching him with a slight tilt in her neck. Like an animal gazing at something they didn’t quite understand. With a final slip of the hand over the blade’s handle, Kor collapsed, mouth agape, into a heap on the floor.

Kiara crouched down beside Kor’s wide-eyed body and withdrew the blade from his neck. She wiped it across the leather patches between his armour plates as she continued her faint smile.

She began to stroke his bloodied cheek.

“Thank you,” she whispered, endearingly. This was perhaps the most tender moment she’d had with Kor; from her point of view anyway. She really did mean the words she spoke. He’d helped her in so many ways, and she really was grateful for it. After a moment, a scream outside reminded her of what was happening in the city beyond her room. She quickly returned to her hiding spot under the bed and listened as the siege continued to unfold outside.

Careful, as to not catch the woodwork around her, she cupped her hands together and let the tiniest of flames burn inside her palm. Slowly, another smile spread across her face. A bigger one this time. An almost joyful grin. Today she lost something — and that was okay. This wasn’t the end of her story, she would find another way. Kor had helped her realise there could be more. She knew her freedom was out there, she just had to find another to help her take it. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> The Backbreaker. The Chain Keeper. The Merchant of Bones. I’m known by many names down here in the darkness. The winding caverns of my lair bored into rock not by machine, or even beast, but the grime-encrusted hands of men clasping splintering wooden picks. These mines run deep. Squalid, narrow and damp, their craggy walls glisten with a sweat that permeates the air like a thick mist. It doesn’t matter that no sun nor heat ever worms its way into this forbidding place, illuminated only by flickering firelight of torches clamped to the bare rock by rusting iron brackets; the graft is so hard no worker fails to leave without a sodden sheen across their filth-ridden brow. Not if I can help it, at least. 

To them, I’m like a fable. A ghost story taken true form. A demon or a bad omen haunting their days. To those above ground though, I’m known by a different name: the foreman. The work is tough, and my masters demanding. But I find I’m delivering more of what they need every day, and I’m praised for it, so I push my drones harder, and become more beast than man in their eyes. The harder I push, the more I become a dread to the workers, but the more they dread me, the happier my masters are.

The dread also serves more purpose. The dread is needed. Without their fear of me, the mines would never deliver all of what my masters desire. Without the Merchant of Bones, our entire world could fall apart. Then where would we be? There is nothing in this bitter, ice-encrusted corner of the world but the work of the mines. No fjords to fish, no fields to till, no timber to chop. I am the whetstone that grinds at the axe that is my home; without me, it would grow dull and lifeless. Without me working these dogs until their hands shook and the jagged floor of the mines ran with their dribbling vomit, the masters would leave, and the world would stop turning. 

***

Emerging from the mines, after the sun has already fallen, bright moonlight clutches the chill air, rebounding off a great and familiar cliff face that looms behind me, gently bathing the world below in a soft blue light.

I take in a breath so crisp and clean I cough it straight back out again. I stay beneath the stony surface of my mine so long that when I leave it, I feel as if the space that has opened up around me is a maw threatening to swallow me whole. This open world always seems alien to me, despite the fact I walk the same path every night and every morning. I might be first into the mine and last out, but it is not my home, a place I am eager to get back to now. A small house on the edge of town; far from people, far the from noise, tight and narrow and quiet, my home is just how I like it. I rush my way up the crest that lays between mining pit and the cityscape, desperate for the clutching embrace of walls. The ground beneath my feet is a frozen slurry of snow met with churned up mud from the days work in the yard. 

Tomorrow is going to be different sort of day. Tomorrow I will find myself wandering the stone-flagged streets of the city that I swiftly press my way towards, but this time while the sun still hangs in the sky. I’ve been summoned. Called up by my masters to attend a public gathering that will discuss what they label ‘a growing concern’ amongst the community about the rigorous nature of our mining. As a rarity, I am the one who experiences that sense dread usually preserved for my workers. Much of the city is tightly packed in, like my mine shafts, which I can find some comfort in, but I’ll be forced to stand in the open courtyard of the town square. My prayers of the past few days have been that I am not required to stand there for long. I tell myself they shouldn’t keep me, my work is too important to be standing around serving their beleaguered politics. At least I am not needed to speak, which is good for I have no mind for speaking; I communicate better with a chain in hand. I leave words to smaller men. 

***

Even as the sun bears down from its place in the cloudless sky, the sheets of snow blanketing the roofs of the tightly-packed greystone houses does not melt. The snow never melts here, and the frost on my breath so heavy it sinks shows exactly why. Even bound up in thick furs, like all the gaunt and dreary pale faces I pass, I feel the cold biting at me. The layers make every man and woman look wide and spry, but beneath them, there is little meat on anyone's bones; so scarce and coveted is food here. Well, my bones are covered in more than most. I am the foreman after all. And if I didn’t have my muscles to lift my chain, the workers would wain, the masters would lose interest, the money wouldn’t flow, and there would be even less food for the hungry. Every eye that falls upon me is sharp and glaring. I feel the hatred rise off them like the smoke billowing from every chimney across the tangled mess of houses that make up this meandering city. Hatred, and hunger for the food they know I’m treated to above them. But they shouldn’t hate me. Without me, they’d all be buried under the snow. Many already were, of course, because of me. More, I mean. More would be buried. 

The time spent outside my precious abode was, as I came to suspect, irrelevant and unfulfilling. The masters merely dragged me out to stand by idly as they tried to placate the growing discontent of this ungrateful town. Maybe they thought an intimidating face would mar the angry voices, or maybe they thought it would quell some of the rumours to see a man, not a beast nor vicious monster as I’d probably been described, standing before them. A folly on their behalf. My presence did little to stem the torrents of rage. Thankfully, the whips of the city guard faired better. A preferable choice, in my opinion. Although my iron chains would have made for even more convincing arguments, had they let me bring them. After the mob was brought to heel, the masters made their point, whether it was pleasing to the masses or not. 

If they wanted coin coming into their desolate little city, in the far reaches of the world between nowhere and fuck-knows-where, they needed to let the mines run, and run deeper and deeper. There was no alternative. To close the mines would mean abandonment from the world beyond our reaches, along with the masters that brought us the only chance of survival. Where else would the people go if the money left? Closure, or even just a slowing of output, would be all but certain death for every man, woman and child here. The brutality required for such a task, and a capitulation to it, was favourable to that, surely? The voices of the crowd took umbrage with this notion, saying they were all dying anyway, so why suffer so badly in the process. They argued, in their pitiful ignorance, that there must be another way. That’s when my name came to bare, and I was forced from the shadows. I knew the best way, it was said. My rule should be followed. 

I don't understand why the masters bothered. I don’t understand why they put stock in the weak and filthy rabble, nor took any credence in their opinions, but still, they tried to make peace. Some hope is better than no hope, was their stance. I had to stifle a laugh when softer voices called for mercy; called for aid from the cities and towns out over the wastes. They said we could find help. The idiots might as well have asked for life to be brought back to a dead hog, such was the futility of what they pleaded for. I left when I was bid to, and not a moment later. Streaking through the town, I ripped through my front door, grasped my chain and slank back down towards the pit. Back to where I belong.

***

The yard seems quieter than normal. Only a few karts are hauled up the hill, packed with stone and into the city. Often long lines of men stood atop the cleft of the mound, gripping tightly to rope and heaving their mud-locked wheels up the slippery slope. Today it was just a smattering of hands. My underlings must have pulled more workers into the mine to fill the day’s quota, with me not there to oversee progress. The hand wrapped around my chain grows tighter as I take harried steps towards the entrance to the mines. 

It’s dark down here. Darker than usual. Or perhaps that is just my morning spent in the dazzling brightness of the sun. Wait. No, it’s definitely darker. There are only a few of brackets burning with lit flames, shrouding most of the tunnel in shadow. Normally, the entire cavern would be bathed in flickering light. It is silent, save for a slow, far off drip. But as I enter one of the longest stretches of darkness, I hear it. A quick shuffling of feet, then hands on my shoulders. Finally, there is a sharp, splitting pain across the back of my head.

***

Whether they meant to or not, they hadn’t killed me. I can feel my own chains wrapped around my wrists, but only barely, the rest of my attention is forced to my pulsating head. It doesn’t so much as hurt as feel heavy. A great sickness hits me like a wave, passing through quickly before another takes its place. I let my head loll forward, but pull it back sharply as the true pain hits. The movement brings forth another burst of sickness. I decide to keep myself steady. A quick and violently excruciating lesson learned. Neither the pulsing nor sickness pass, but my stillness does give my eyes a chance to flicker around the spinning chamber. A space cut into the mine where tools are normally kept, it is now laid bare, two torches hung either side of the pitch-black archway that lays a few strides ahead of me, crackling softly in the otherwise deftly silence. There are no sounds of pickaxes on stone. No sounds of workers trundling karts up or down the shaft, or miners screaming as more work is goaded from them. The silence fills me with fear. I might be restrained, tied to a wooden chair by my own chains and plumped down ready for some form of integration, but nothing churns my stomach more than the thought of the master’s wrath if the mines fail to deliver. Or perhaps, the churning of my stomach comes from the pulsing growing heavier upon the back of my skull.

They enter now, three of them, ducking low through the archway. At least, I think it’s three. My blurred and swirling vision could be playing tricks on me, but I’m fairly certain it’s three. Their frames are all narrow, clad in ragged clothing and skin thick with dirt stains so engrained no amount of scrubbing is cleaning them off. Each brandishes some kind of weapon, dull metal reflecting the dancing flames, although my eyes can’t focus enough to see exactly what they are. 

“The Merchant of Bones.” One addresses me in a sneering tone. “Brought to heel.” 

“A pig of the mines, bringing itself to slaughter.” I spit back. Suddenly gathering the taste of blood in my mouth, I feel splits in my apparently swollen lips. The realisation brings an awareness of pain to my face, and to the bruising from an unconscious beating I probably received. I now notice my vision might also be strained from my right eyelid that swells heavily. I wonder what else I could be missing. Is my leg broken, perhaps? There are too many agonies to focus on, the sound of the scum’s voice before me the worst of all, as he speaks again.

“We’re here to bargain, not die.”

I laugh. It’s not fake. I throw my head back with merriment but the swell of pain and nausea hits me far too quickly, and far too hard. I lurch forward to vomit on their feet. They in turn recoil, stepping away quickly with gasps of repulsion. Sputtering and coughing out the remnants of bile that swill around my mouth, I find myself grinning a self-satisfied grin. 

“Apologies.” I croak, mockingly, unable to find a clear voice through the burning in my throat and the aching in my head. 

“Look, Chain Keeper.” Another says, stepping forward. In my hazed vision, set to the floor, I see his boots tread in the pool of sick laid across it. He squats down on his haunches in front of me, trying to get my attention. 

As my head swims, I avoid his gaze. I see his hands twitch. I know he wants to grab at my face, to pull my focus to his eyes, but he daren’t touch me. Not for fear, but disgust at the dribbles of vomit I can feel on the chin. “We’re not here for death. We’ve had enough of that.” He goes on as I let out another, less emphatic, laugh. “We want things to change down here, for the better. And you can make that happen.”

“How?” I grin up at him, finally meeting his eyes, or at least, trying to. Mine can’t seem to hold a focal point, but as they fade in and out in the flickering light of the dingy chamber, I notice his are fixed. 

“We need machines in the mines. We need better tools and more food. If you stop the beatings we can work harder. If you make it easier for us, we can bring up more stone.” The man speaks with an authority, with a strength I thought I’d crushed down here in my domain. I’d have to work harder at that once I was free of these chains. “It isn’t the work that kills us, it’s you.”

“Okay, done. Now let me go.” I say with more mocking tone to my voice. We both know well enough it doesn’t end so simply. He sighs at my humour; or maybe he has realised his own ignorance too late.

“You don’t go free. Not yet.” 

“No?” I choke indignantly. “Then when?”

“We here.” He gestures around the room. “We four come to an agreement. We take you before the townsfolk with that agreement. They rally to us. We all go to the masters. The masters have no choice but to meet our more than reasonable demands. Then the miners go back to work all peaceful like.”

“So simple.” I chide. “I have to wonder why you didn’t just corral the mob in the in the square today?” 

“You are leverage.” Spoke up another of the men behind him. Was it the one who spoke first, was it the other? I couldn’t tell and I didn’t care to try and figure it out. I just nodded with them. It is a gentle nod, but it hurts less than I thought it might. I let it become a little bit of a fiercer nod. Testing my limits…

I rustle at my chains. The man looks around my back but doesn’t move from his squat. He doesn’t fear my escape, it would seem. 

“Your plan,” I say with a considering tone. “Is not actually too bad.”

I shift my head to one side in an agreeable gesture. I find the sickness stays at bay.

“But…” I continue, pausing just long enough to really draw in their attention and, more importantly, give me time to steady myself. “You’ve made a mistake.”

“Explain it to me.” The man before me says calmly. He really isn’t afraid. He really thinks the upper hand is his. This is why they don’t put the dregs of the mines in charge of anything actually important. This is why they give them to me to do with whatever I see fit.

“What you say is true. If we cut the beatings. If we improved lives of the miners. Yes, we probably could harvest more stone than we do now.” I admit. “But the masters have no need for all that fucking useless rock.”

I quickly slip my hands together and loosen the subtly built-in catch on the central link of my chain, splitting them in two. Now separate swinging weapons, they remain bound to my wrists as I leap to my feet. I knock the man ahead of me onto his back with a crack; a crack not as loud as those of the skulls, though. I raise my arms and slam the iron chains down heavy on each of his co-conspirators. They strike true, blood gushing from grotesque head wounds as both men fall. One to his knees, gasping slightly as he slumps, the other straight down like a sack of coal. 

It is now that it hits me: the pain and terrible sickness. I stumble forward, reaching for the wall to steady myself, my roiling head flashing streaks of light before my eyes, then patches of darkness where the light had once been. I fight back the urge to vomit, for a moment, before the retches come in waves and what is left of my stomach contents spills out over the harsh cavern floor. I feel a faintness almost take me, but my resolve keeps me upright as I notice the still living man in the corner of my eye, scrabbling to his feet. I try to wheel around on him, the chains dangling at my side, but instead I just collapse against the jagged stone wall and painfully slide to the ground, bumping on pointed edges as I go. I hit the ground with a heavy thud, which shoots pain up my back and strikes at my head. I gasp and cry out, unable to hold in the noise.

He’s on top of me now, gripping at my cheeks. He isn’t afraid of the vomit anymore. I know his hands are there, because they shake my head to keep me conscious, and I see them in faded outlines of my vision, but I can’t feel them. I can’t feel anything but burning coursing through my entire body, prickling at my skin. 

“What do you mean, useless rock?” He demands, and I can’t help but let out another laugh in spite of myself; in spite of everything. I play through the idea of not saying anything at all, but then a thought comes to me: A thought of the insolence and disrespect I’ve received for so long. The hate. The looks of disgust. They despise me, these people. They despise me and all I’ve ever done is keep this fucking hovel of a town alive. Now, on my way out, with no burden of loyalty or lives to care for, why not take the whole place with me? Why not let this desolate little corner of the world burn to the ground? The simple truth would do that.

“What did you mean?” He roars, shaking me evermore violently. 

“The stone...” I say, hoping he’ll relax his grip at my words, at least long enough for me to enjoy a final slump against the floor. He does and I wither like a flower, sliding to the ground and curling my body around the arched walls of the rocky chamber. “The stone means nothing to the masters.”

“Then why do we work down here?” He shouts. “Why do we die for it?” 

“Because that is what they want. They want death.” 

My vision is patchy and my ears ring. The man says nothing for a long time. Have I gone deaf? No.

“What?” He says eventually, voice riddled with confusion.

“The masters want bodies, not stones. The mining work is a front. A lie to satiate the crowds. To kill with impunity without people knowing they are actually being killed and not just dying instead. It is to give reason to what is, basically, murder. We don’t trade in stone, we trade in livestock. You and your filthy lot are the livestock.”

He says nothing, so I carry on. I can only imagine the look on his face, because I can’t see it. 

“They do work on the dead. Experiments. I don’t know what, but they need fresh bodies all the time. We drive the men brutally in the mines, pushing them to breaking point, to an early grave, under the claim the stone is needed for money to come in, but really the money comes in for the bodies we bring up.”

“Why not just kill us all now and get it over with?” He asks with a helpless tone. 

“Because then the well would run dry. The mines mean a slow and steady supply. Well…” I laugh again. I haven’t laughed this much in a very, very long time. “It was slow at first, but their needs have grown, as you’ve come to notice.”

“And that is it? That is why you torture us down here? Why so many die so needlessly? That is why you’ve become the Merchant of Bones? Because that really is who you are? A trader in death.”

I go to nod but I can’t actually move my head anymore. I just let a low grumble of agreement instead. 

I feel a warmth against my forehead. I open my eyes to see something red slowly oozing out around me. My head wound must have reopened and was now draining itself across the ground. No wonder I feel so faint even her on the floor. I close my eyes, then open them again. I can no longer see the blood. There is little to my vision now but blinding white lights, despite the darkness of the cave I know I’m still in. Even when I close them, the light remains, consuming all the spaces of my head. 

“How do we stop this?” 

My laughter comes again. This time in short, ragged bursts. I’m struggling to take in air, but a sickeningly joyous emotion overtakes me and I can’t help but rasp in breath between my fits of laughter. What a fool. What a misguided, ignorant fool. His words sound like a prayer to a god that will never answer. Pleading and desperate. I let my jaw hang slack and drag in a final breath. 

“You join me.” I smile.  <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> My mother once told me that monsters are not born, they are made. I used to take that very literally. Believing that, somewhere, monsters were being sculpted like clay pots and thrown into the world to terrorise us all. As I grew older, I realised what she really meant. I watched from a cage as my brother strangled her to death. That made him a monster. I heard the yelps of my father as my sister cut him with shallow slices, ensuring his last moments was as painful as possible. That made her a monster, too. But one man’s monster can be another’s hero. Monsters are like beauties, they fit into the eye of the beholder. My brother and sister are monsters to me, but not to others. The slaying of my mother and father brought about a new order to our small corner of the world. Cultists, a group with a single burning desire to appease their own monsters of the underworld, took control of my brother and sister, and indeed every inch of land under the rule of my family.

Our kingdom sat on a luscious peninsula on the western corner of the world. The joint that linked us to the mainland was narrow and set atop towering cliffs, as were most of our shores. An impregnable iron gate; set between thick stone walls, kept our kingdom out of the reaches of the wilder folk that lived in the lands outside our territory. For where we had water and life, the world stretching beyond was baron; an arid desert of sand and bone. Many had sought to take our kingdom; marauders, desperate and unhinged. All had failed to break the gates or climb the cliffs, but that’s not how the cultists seized power. Their words, not weapons, won them their war. They poisoned the minds of my siblings. They came as traders; allowed passage through the gates because they carried no weapons, nor spoke no ill but offered great knowledge and riches.

Their disguise was perfect. Once inside, they sort to corrupt all three children, but not all could be taken in. I quickly grew suspicious of their fixation on death, rituals and monsters, and I was cast aside for it. My younger siblings were not so apprehensive. I warned my parents, but they dismissed it as a phase; exploration of the mind and spirit, my father said. They’d become so used to the threat of the sword, so condition to the stupidity of the marauders of the desert, they’d lost sight of how wars are truly won and lost. Over the course of two years, my sibling’s minds were turned. Slowly, subtly and very carefully. I knew why, of course. As the eldest, I was adopted as the people’s royal. I was involved in everything that went on in our peninsula. While my parents governed, I was the face of the family. My younger siblings were not needed, and they found it hard to find their own place in our world. Pushed aside by the family, and ignored by the people, they had very little worth in themselves.

Then, somebody offered them something meaningful, and they took it.

I don’t see them often anymore, I’m not sure what role they play in the cult, but when I do, they use the word ‘spared’ a lot. I don’t feel it’s a word that summarises their choice in keeping me alive. Imprisoned would be something of an accurate description; captured, perhaps. They keep me on the furthest northern shore, with most of the other tributes. Our numbers grow day-by-day, the cultists allowing those who once attempted to attack our kingdom, the marauders, passage and sanctuary, in return for service to their unholy activities. Their existence within our world has made it a very different place. Before the cultists took power, our peninsula was populated by a few thousand people. Mainly farmers or fishermen, civilised and peaceful. Now, as the dregs of the desert have bled inside the walls, it has become a very different place. A culture of barbarism followed them. Brutish and violent. They drink, they fight, they murder in the street. When people like that meet with the civilised inhabitants, the barbarians win. For a time, the streets were mayhem. Our peaceful little villages transformed, from well kept thatched homes with beautiful flowers adorning the windows to places of ruin. Families were kicked out of their homes, which were then ransacked and torn apart. Tents sprung up across villages and its outskirts. Before long, my particular settlement looked more like a war camp than the picturesque little fishing village it used to be. Most villagers had fled further inland, to some of the quieter areas of the peninsula, though none were truly safe now the gates were firmly open. But I couldn’t leave. I lived in a cage, the same cage I’d spent most my days inside since the cultists overthrew my family. I was here, along with those residents who’d also been forced to these shores — most of which were loyalists to my family, given the choice of death or ‘tribution’ — for one purpose: to slay monsters.

These were not monsters like my siblings, these were monsters of the sea. The cultists worshipped a few gods, but the greatest of them all was a giant with an unpronounceable name. The fanatics believed that, if fed the most monstrous creatures of all, the giant would step down from above and walk in the realm of the living. Fish wouldn’t feed him, nor would corn or even cow; it would take true monsters. What would feed him were terrifying beasts few had ever laid eyes on. The task before them was simple: hunt the monsters and bring them back to be laid before the God as a feast worthy of deities. If they failed to feed their God, his wrath would be terrible, so they said. He would destroy the heavens above, leaving nothing in the afterlife but darkness. This was how they justified their mission; or rather, their control. Thus, the monsters sought monsters to awaken a monster. Well, that wasn’t strictly true. They never sought the monsters themselves.

I woke to a hot streak of blood lashing my cheek. Above me, two men stood, in the midst of a fight. One held a makeshift dagger in his hand, its blade glistening with blood, while the other clutched his wounded arm. The two were circling, waiting for the other to make a move, kicking up dust from the dirt floor at each other, before feigning lunges and springing back into place. Gripping the cold metal cage bars on which I leant, I heaved myself upright and strode right between the two men. They were both bald and slim; like every man kept in these cages. Skin and bone, but with broad shoulders. I eyed each one of them in turn, shaking my head. My narrow gaze and stoic expression was all they needed. Both backed off each other, nodded in my direction, and then in each others, before retreating to different corners of the cage.

“Drop it,” I said quietly, but a firm inflexion. The man wielding his makeshift blade opened his palm and let it fall to the floor. Too late was my intervention though. The overseer had arrived, rattling the cage.

“What are you rats doing?”

The overseers were from the lands beyond the wall, further even than the marauders. We didn’t have many here, but they made their presence known. Seven feet tall, their faces were rounded and their bodies effortlessly muscular. They had a brutal look about them; dangerous. This one had wild yellow eyes, which flickered around the cage to all eight occupants. He let out a snarl from his curled lips, the corners of which had two, very small tusks poking out from beneath tough and dry mounds of skin. Carefully, he unlocked the door to the cage, bent down and entered, a large cleaver in hand. The overseers were a weird sort of person, thought to have been mixed with another species somewhere in their ancestry, although nobody was quite sure what. This one alone could easily take us all on without his weapon. He glowered around the cage, catching sight of the wounded man.

“Fightin’s for dogs!” He roared, smashing a fist twice the size of a normal man’s against the rusty bars. He spotted the makeshift blade on the ground, before casting another, even angrier look around. His eyes came to rest on me, and the blood on my cheek.

“Does the princess need lessons in making friends?” He said, in a sharp, vicious tone. I watched as he lent over to pick up and examine the blade and soon I found him towering over me. I saw the attacker, the man who had whittled the makeshift knife and slashed our cellmate, rise to claim responsibility. Out of sight of the imposing figure, who’s malicious gaze was fixed on my face, I raised a hand and gestured for him to stay quiet. The blame was on me now, another’s voice would just enrage the half-man, half-beast more.

“The arms are valuable.” The overseer bellowed, splattering my face with spit. “Next time…” He gripped the handle of the knife tightly, before ramming it into my thigh. “Go for somewhere less important”.

Withdrawing the blade, he swiftly left the cage, slamming the door shut. Clutching my bleeding leg, I slipped to the floor. Looking up through bars to the grey, turbulent skies above, trying to leave my agony on the ground and lift myself out of this prison. It didn’t work. The pain was overwhelming. I gritted my teeth as the man responsible for the knife’s existence came to kneel beside me.

“I’m sorry”. He whispered.

“Why did you attack him anyway, Bolo?” I asked through seethes of agony, hoping to distract my mind.

“He ate that rat that kept coming into the cage.”

“Hornball?” I exclaimed. I glanced a look over to the other bleeding member of our pack of caged men, he too was clutching his knife wound with a pained expression. “I hope that hurts!”

Bolo sat beside me. “You can see the way we look up to you, right? How every one of us looks up to you.”

“Stop.” I moaned, I knew where this was going.

“We’ll follow you. All you have to do is lead. We can take our home back, I know it.”

“I can’t do it.” I breathed with a fragile note. “So many would die. If not us all. I cannot bear the idea of costing one man his life, let alone hundreds.”

“Life? What life is this?” Bolo gestured around the cage. Men in rags slung up against bars. Bruised, malnourished and dishevelled. “I remember what life was like before this. It’s all I cling to.”

“You know I would gladly give my life for this place to be free, Bolo. But not theirs.”

Three suns rose and set before I did anything else other than eat, sleep and relieve myself through the bars of my cast-iron prison. I dreamt nightly of being free of this place. Away from it all. It was all I wanted. I didn’t want to fight. I didn’t want to rebel. I just wanted to be free. The grey clouds had started to clear, and the cold sea air was starting to warm just a little bit. As dawn broke on the fourth day, the overseer arrived, flanked by a marauder, to march the tributes down, through the dilapidated old town, to the docks. There we met with other overseers, marauders and a small army of prisoners, and were loaded into a group of ten rowing boats. Each boat was manned by eight rowers, four on each side. At the bow of the boat was a large, mounted crossbow. The formidable piece of weaponry fired a single bolt. Thicker than a human leg and tipped with a barbed, serrated arrowhead, these machines of death existed for one purpose: to slay giants. The crossbow was operated by a marauder, with an overseer sat in the middle of the boat, ready to load the immensely heavy metal bolts, should they be needed. They very rarely were. Not in all my time at sea had I seen anything that needed such a bolt.

Once aboard, the prisoner’s legs were chained to the floor, but arms kept free to manoeuvre the ores. I watched my wounded cellmate warily as he sat down. Our injuries were recovering, slowly, but I was still struggling to walk and I knew this trip would take its toll on him. I hoped the overseer would show mercy, although I wasn’t confident. He stood there, a long, curled whip in hand, cleaver attached to his belt, watching as we pulled away from the harbour in unison with the other boats and headed out to open water. Behind me was a new member of the crew, a young lad from north of the peninsula, taken into service of the cult; probably for some horrifyingly unjust reason. I didn’t like to ask how people ended up in the cage anymore, it didn’t help and it just made my blood boil. The cultists were getting ever more desperate for a meal to offer their God, bringing in more and more people to their hunt for less and less meaningful reasons. Some of the followers were growing restless, with a number of executions having taken place over recent months of those calling the leaders of the cult false prophets. With ‘heretics’, marauders and subjugated locals under their rule, the cultists lead with an iron fist. Life in the cages, and the villages in which they sat, seemed rough, but from the stories I had heard, life beyond them wasn’t that pleasant either.

We spent all afternoon bobbing up and down, seeking out a prize worthy of the cult’s demands, and finding nothing. The sound of the ocean sloshing against the boat was only broken by the paddling of ores, the groans of men and the crack of a whip when somebody’s pace fell behind. I could see the wounded man beside me, struggling through the pain; red-faced and dripping with sweat. Eventually, it was too much. His wound was oozing blood, he let out a yelp of pain and hoisted his ore out the water, leaning against it so it wouldn’t drag the others back. The boat started listing off course without his input. Growling, the overseer gripped him by the throat and squeezed. Tears streaked down the man’s face as he choked.

“If you didn’t want to deal with the pain, you should have moved faster!” The overseer bellowed, throwing the man down against the deck. “Now row!”

Another crack of the whip followed, with that in turn followed by an agonising scream. Blood streaming down his shoulder, he kept rowing. The sight of him tore me apart inside. It was impossible to watch. The pain must have been unbearable.

In the distance, the tip of a mountainous island loomed above a fog that surrounded it. The marauder pointed to it “Steer clear of the mist, we run aground in there and we’ll all drown”. The boat started to turn, running parallel to the mist that lazily rolled its way towards us. Suddenly, the boat jolted sideways.

We’d been hit.

The hump of a massive creature — an animal that must have measured some seventy foot, out matching our little boat by about four times — rose out of the ocean, knocking our craft, before disappearing into the surf as the beast dove into the depths. As it slid beneath the waves, two spined fins on either side of its body cut through the water, creating dramatic looking ripples like somebody had just run through it with a sword. Moments later, another beast broke the surface nearby, then another behind us, and two more ahead of us. We were in the thick of them; a group of the massive animals heading straight for the mists of the island.

“Is this what we’re hunting?” The newest member of our crew asked, peering out at the impressive looking animals as the last one disappeared under the shimmering blue ocean.

“No.” I answered quietly, “These are what our monster hunts.”

“They’re going into the mist” The marauder shouted, snapping around to look at the overseer.

“Well…” The overseer grumbled. “What are we waiting for? Follow them!”

Soon, every boat in the convoy was being rowed into the fog. It clung low to the ocean’s surface at first, but as we got deeper in, it built into an all-consuming mass that surrounded us. Eventually, we couldn’t even see the boat closest to us, all swallowed by the freezing grey mist. The air felt thick in my lungs as I, along with the other rowers, slowed the pace to carefully drift through the dense patches of fog. Both the overseer and the marauder were looking around warily, for sight of monster or rock.

The silence was striking. In the midst of the fog, seemingly alone, with enormous sea creatures hidden somewhere beneath the dark water below, even in the boat I felt vulnerable. For a while there was nothing, we just floated gently, in a state of tranquil unease. Again, the creatures started to rise from the water around us, before dipping back below. They seemed totally uninterested in our being there. They also moved very slowly, not in the frenzied state of an animal fleeing for its life. There were no monsters to be found here.

Then came another knock, as one of the beasts surfaced right beneath the boat. We lurched backwards in its wake. Before the boat could steady, the marauder lost his footing and was thrown forward and into the icy depths. The overseer immediately jumped up to reach for him and in this moment, I was overcome with instinct. I caught sight of my wounded crew member. Looking faint, weak and helpless. His armed coated in blood, his face pale. I saw in my mind, the overseer as his drove a blade into my aching leg. I pictured the cages, I thought of my brother and sister. Of my home that lay in ruin. Without another thought, without hesitation, I snatched the cleaver from the overseer’s belt, raised it high and slammed it into the overseer’s neck. Still leant over the side of the boat, he let out a muted gasp before slumping over the side and falling into the water beside the marauder. I kept my hand clutched onto the cleaver, wrenching it from his body as he fell.

“What are you doing?” Came the cry of the marauder through splutters of water. Quickly, I hacked at my chains and broke free. As the hand of the marauder clenched the side of the boat, I took off its fingers in one, bloody swipe. The man fell back into the waves, his howls of agony broken by choking and desperate coughing. Standing over the side of the boat, I heaved the bolt that was wedged into the crossbow under my shoulders and threw it into the water. It was so heavy I could only hurl it a few feet, but it was enough to come crashing down on the marauders head. I couldn’t tell if it knocked him out or killed him, but it didn’t matter. He floated limply, head down in the water, beside the body of the overseer. If the blow didn’t finish him, the water would.

After so much panic and noise, there was now silence. I stood and watched as the bodies floated away, disappearing into the mist, as if being pulled into the afterlife. All that was left was a trail of blood floating on the surface of the water.

I turned to greet the stunned faces of my crew. They watched me with a mixture of expressions. Most shocked, others scared, but soon the atmosphere changed.

“Yes!” Bolo grinned. “Yes! It’s time boys!

Bolo sparked something in the men. A sense of freedom filing their minds. They looked at me expectantly, as if waiting for some speech. I didn’t know what to say. This wasn’t a rebellion. Was it?

“We must be ready. Someone may find the bodies or see us without an overseer.” The words were clearly not what the men expected, but they were unanimous in the nods and grumbles of agreement all the same.

Cleaver in hand, I broke Bolo’s chains and helped him to his feet. Together, we slotted a bolt into the crossbow, while the others watched on. As we winched back the firing pin, something caught my ears. I beckoned for all to fall silent, not that a word was being said or sound being made.

Through the silence, we could hear the paddling of another boat. It was getting nearer.

“Stay low, let them get close”. I said, dropping down, so that I could only just see over the top of the artillery. The others followed my orders without question.

Creeping through the fog, I saw a lone boat heading towards us.

“Hey!” the marauder manning the crossbow called out. “You see anything?”

The boat drew nearer.

“Hello?” they called out again.

In a quieter voice, carried over the water, I made out the words: ‘Looks like there’s nobody in the boat.”

The sound of ores breaking against the water grew louder and faster as a whip crack sailed through the air. They were nearly upon us now, soon they’d see the men lying in the boat, the lack of marauder and overseer and me, a prisoner walking free, manning the crossbow. Spinning the weapon around so it was directed at the boat, I sprang up to check my alignment and release the firing pin.

The bolt flew straight and true through the still air, spearing the marauder, spattering the crew with blood, and sending him flying backwards. The bolt split the hull of the small boat and water soon poured in. The boat was sinking quickly, the overseer looking around wildly, trying to plug the leak. He hoisted the impaled marauder up and threw his blood-soaked corpse into the ocean; which was a mistake. Even more water poured in, the rowers were panicking, their feet chained the boat. They scrambled helplessly, trying to undo the locks, crying out in fear, pleading for help. I watched helplessly, as the boat sank further and further down. I was frozen, shocked by the horror unfolding before my eyes. In a mighty show of strength, the overseer gripped the side of the boat, tore off a piece of wood and leapt into the water, using it to stay afloat, leaving the trapped crew to die.     

“Save them!” Called out a voice from behind me, but I knew it was no good.

The chains were beneath the waves now. No strike, no matter how precise, would slice fast enough through the water to smash those chains. There was nothing to be done but watch as the boat dropped lower and lower beneath the water. Soon, the panic-stricken men took their final, gasping breaths, before behind dragged under. The last one to go locked eyes with me. Eyes full of nothing more than utter terror. My body, my mind, my heart; it was all numb. I watched him slip beneath the water, moments later, bubbles rippled on the surface, then all was quiet.

“You!” bellowed the floating overseer. “What have you done?”

Quietly, without a word or show of emotion, I leaned over and beckoned for Bolo to hand me another bolt. He did so, silently; he wasn’t smiling anymore.

The whole boat was silent, unable to process the horror they had just witnessed.

“Break the chains,” I whispered as Bolo hoisted the bolt into my arms, handing him the cleaver.

Whilst I loaded the weapon, he moved around, cracking the chains of all the crew. I drew my focus upon the overseer, who was not ignorant to my plan. He hurriedly started kicking his feet, trying to move away and into the safety of the mist. But he was heavy, cumbersome and very immobile in the water. In the time it took him to turn, I had the weapon loaded. It wasn’t a direct hit, but the bolt was so heavy it cracked his skull as it slid over his head. More blood poured into the water as he drifted lazily away from his wooden raft.

I turned, sat and faced the crew, tears streaming down my cheeks. They said nothing. No words of condemnation or consolation. They just watched me with stunned expressions. Then, the sound of more ores.

“We have to move. Try and free more”, came a quiet voice from the back.

“No.” I sighed, defeated. “We cannot risk it.”

“But, our freedom?” Bolo protested feebly.

“Are we not free?” I retorted, rattling a broken chain in his direction.

“The people? Our home?”

I said nothing. I just got up, sat by my ore and started to row. Slowly, the others joined me. My whole body shook. I expected to feel pain, anger, anguish, guilt. But I just felt nothing. My body and mind were numb.

Soon, we found ourselves leaving the mist behind, and left with a choice nobody wanted to make.

“What do we do now?” asked Bolo.

I didn’t know what to tell him. After a long pause, It was our new crew member spoke up.

“We should follow the coast south, make landfall outside the wall, find some-” But his words were cut short. Heading straight towards us was a figure, a beast of the ocean, but this wasn’t another of the giants we’d seen today.

It almost slithered across the surface like a snake, moving from side to side. Only its scaled back could be seen, along which ran three long jagged ridges. It only just poked out of the water but was clearly far larger than what we could see. The creature’s length was near impossible to guess, but as it passed us, seemingly oblivious to our presence, the shadow beneath the waves looked to be larger than any warship I’d ever seen. Twice or three times that, in fact.

The monster descended, its back slinking beneath the surface, as it headed off towards the island shrouded by mist.

We all watched on, unable to believe our eyes.

“That’s what we were hunting,” Bolo said to our newest crew member, after another long silence.

“Must have been drawn by those massive fish things” the young man mused.

“Or blood,” I uttered coldly under my breath.

We carried on rowing, following the plan of heading south and finding shelter on the coast away from the reach of the cultists. I couldn’t help but think, as we gently sailed towards freedom, about monsters.

The massive creature, hunting its prey.

The outcast brother and sister who betrayed their ignorant family.

The fearful cultists appeasing a vengeful God.

The supposed Prince of the people, whose bloodlust left his men without a hope and took others to their grave; not before he abandoned those left behind to servitude as he sought his own freedom.

I wondered, if monsters were not born but made, if I just crafted one that could satisfy the hunger of even the angriest of Gods. Was I the biggest monster to haunt this land, even if I were not the size of great warships? <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Dragon Girl
By Cat Sparks
I fell in love with a dragon boy when I was seventeen. The dragon train—five creatures long—camped near Grimpiper in the days before it crossed the Great Divide. Beyond the stones lay the Dead Red Heart. Our ’stead nestled in amongst the shadow dunes. Close enough to the Sand Road, not too close to its bandits and its warlords.

We’d been pushing our water wheels across miles of stone when the kite went up. Blue tail flags might mean many things but this time blue meant drag­ons. We dropped the wheels and ran up Puckers Ridge. Right to the top and there they were, five dragons chewing through wild melon fields below. Thick-set creatures, bellies low to the ground.


We risked a whipping, abandoning our wheels like that, but dragons were too tempting to pass up. Nothing ever happened out Grimpiper way. We could not know then that the train would camp for three full days, and when it left, I would be leaving too.

The youngest of his tribe, he was. His beast trod last in line. His dragon smaller than the others by a head. Broad, flat teeth ripping through dune mel­on stems.

“Does it bite?” I asked.

Iago (I didn’t know his name back then) shot me a playful grin. Tossed me one of the loose dune melons. I held it coyly, watching him stand so close to that chomping mouth. Close enough to make the other girls shriek. He tossed the melon. The dragon snapped it up. “You try,” he said and so I did, dallying with the beast for hours, until Carlina and her Noahan witches came stream­ing down the dunesides, waggling their palm frond shades, weighted down with baskets of throwing stones. Chanting lists of animals that had been res­cued by the boat and how no dragons were written on that list. Dragons were abominations, made by human hands. The same dab hands that brought the Ruin down. All misborn beasts must be driven across the Great Divide, was what they preached. That, and a host of other, darker things.

I didn’t care about what Noahan witches said. Their praying and their whining never rose the water table or brought the rain or caused the crops to grow.

Iago’s people were tall and dark, dressed in sand cloaks, deep blue like the night. Merchentman—or so I thought—with ancient rifles slung across their shoulders. For show, they were, not fighting guns, but you never could be sure with Heartland folks.

Carlina stared with big wide eyes when she saw that thunderstick, all chipped and grey and mounted on spindle legs. A fearsome thing, even with its fire drained.

“For serpente hunting,” Iago told me.

Iago’s uncle never said a word. He stared me down as the Noahan’s chant­ing drove the other girls away. I ignored them all, keeping up the melon game, watching lithe, brown-skinned Iago unwrap his turban and shake his long hair free.

Couldn’t keep my eyes off him. We fucked in the shade of a withered copse of palms. Didn’t care who saw us. Didn’t even wait for night to fall.

“I’m not afraid of your uncle,” I told him.

“You should be,” his reply. Later, he told me how the dragons were not re­ally dragons. Lizards, more like. Creatures bred in glass. True dragons were supposed to have had wings, their bones turned hard and trapped in stone for centuries.

I knew then that I would leave Grimpiper and the shadow dunes. The No­ahans and the farmers, goat herders and beekeepers, fighting over water rights to the last uncontaminated wells. Mother shrieking after me to look out for my brother. Flint, who had hit the pilgrim trail, one year gone, his name not spoken since.

I remember laughing, warm wind blowing in my face. Getting sweaty with Iago, shirking chores and hanging at the dragon’s feet. Telling no one of my plan to leave, except Iago who had known it from the first.

We were five days out when I learned the truth of it. The dragon train sought not new wells as Iago’s uncle claimed. They followed the pilgrim trail them­selves in search of Ankahmada. The same cursed city that enticed my brother to his doom. A city carved from a living sapphire, rumoured to be blooming in the Dead Red Heart. A pilgrim trail grown cold and strewn with bones. My brother’s most likely lain amongst them.

The Dead Red Heart, land of stonewhales, skates and serpentes. The most we had glimpsed so far were ruins and the bones of creatures long dead past. Maps by day and stars by night. Lands so repetitious they could barely be en­dured. We travelled under the sun’s full glare, protected by flimsy canopies. Each beast flanked by point riders on camelback.

Dogs ran at the dragons’ feet. They never tired or weakened. Dogs kept other predators at bay. Other dogs, mostly, and other things that looked a bit like dogs. Our beasts were fed and watered well, even when the rest of us were parched.

Iago’s uncle never spoke a word to me. Few of the drovers were much for speaking words. They spoke in sign, signalling back and forth across the sand, that thunderstick remaining in plain view, attached to Iago’s uncle’s camel’s saddle.

Wedged behind Iago, travelling last in line. Scanning horizons for serpente sign, chewing on leathery roo jerky and ember bread. Talking about the people we had lost: him two sisters stricken by the sweating fever. Me my one and only brother, leaving home without saying goodbye. The heat of the sun and the chill of the night. Sleeping upright in the saddle, sliding in and out of dreams, awakening under a different hue of sky, sometimes on an entirely different day.

The dragon people thought the sapphire city real. They carried tiny chips and shards of it in battered leather pouches. Held them up against the light, comparing them for purity. Poring over faded maps so creased and crushed they barely held a mark.

My mother collected Dead Red maps. She had close on to forty, every one a clever fake. The cheapest kinds you could score at any Sand Road trading post. Some were inked on ancient crumbling paper, others on treated hide, fabric or faded plastic.

I believed in many things: the Obsidian Sea and the giant ships that slid across it’s surface, borne on massive old-world butyl rollers, thick sails bulging with wild winds. Travellers claimed to have seen such craft push out from Fal­low Heel. Souvenirs slung around their necks, wards and sigils carved from the slick black glass. But Ankahmada, a city carved from jewel? Not even a Noahan witch would fall for that one.

Fifteen days beyond Grimpiper’s wells, I awoke to the sound of human voices. Iago, conferring with one of the camel riders—a man with his face obscured beneath a striped khafiya—both of them pointing to a dusty smudge that might have been no more than a pile of rocks. No kites hanging in the listless sky. If it was an outpost or a ’stead, its people did not wish to draw attention.

Iago’s uncle rode his camel ahead, spyglass at the ready. Dragons plodding in a firm and steady line.

“Watch,” said Iago.

“Watch what?” And then I saw it, a sliver-glint of sun. A flashing signal, pat­terned. No accidental reflection. Someone was trying to speak to us. I braced myself to swerve towards the light but we did not.

Iago’s uncle appeared as disinterested as his camel. Iago, however, kept a keen eye on that flashing. More handsign passed between him and his cousins, swiveled in their saddles as the dragons took us closer. The glint and smudge took shape and form—a row of columns protruding from the sand. The dark, squat shapes of scattered tents and pens.

Three small boys burst from behind a low dune crest, running towards us, waving hands, shouting words of greeting in a mix of tongues.

Iago was not pleased to see them. The boys kept up their loud distractions. Iago’s uncle regarded them with distaste. Iago tightened the grip on his drag­on’s reigns. The boys whooped and cheered, racing back the way they’d come, tripping and tumbling over their own feet. Four bells gave the dragons’ signal. They pulled up to a slow stop, one by one.

Iago’s uncle had apparently changed his mind.

I wrapped my arms around Iago’s waist. “What is happening? What is this place?”

“Trading post,” he answered grimly. He handed me the precious spyglass he wore around his neck on a strip of leather.

Grimpiper ‘steads were parched and sparse, but even the meanest and driest of them was a grand bazaar compared to this sorry array. A handful of scrawny goats bleated miserably in ramshackle pens of unevenly-hammered stakes. The way was strewn with camel bones. Three mangy, fly-blown dogs growled at our own dogs and at the dragons. Catching their scent, but without the energy to jump and bark. So utterly malnourished, they might have been the undead demon dogs those Noahans swore ran rampant through the Red.

Our own dogs kept a wary distance. Dogs that had never before shown a lick of fear.

We were as close as we were going to get. Movement stirred at the bases of the columns. Just the wind, or so I thought at first.

I sat up, straight and saddlesore, straining for a clearer view.

Iago’s uncle wasn’t getting off his mount. He stared at the trading post a lengthy while before sending two point riders to investigate. Neither man looked happy with the task.

“What do you reckon he’s after?” I whispered.

Iago and I shared the glass between us, watching our riders approach the men who sat gambling around a coarse and tattered mat. Coins glinted sharply against the weave. Weapons placed within easy reach. Now and then, a glance would be thrown in the direction of the tents.

Tents that were thin and patched and faded. Through an open flap, a group of people peered. Women and children, they ranged in age from elderly down to a babe in arms. Their clothes were old, their faces tanned and lined.

The women whispered amongst themselves until one of the men called out, demanding silence. Abruptly, the women shushed, then the tent flap fell.

At seventeen, I knew little of the world’s true pain, but this was plain as day. A slave market. The captives miserable wisps of skin and bone, huddled around the columns, weighted down with chains. The men on the mat were cowardly dogs, each one hung with the totems, tools and trophies of his trade. Men whose stench I could smell from the dragon’s back. I would have spat except they weren’t worth the water.

The condition of their animals spoke to many truths. Animals are every­thing, from Grimpiper all the way to Sammarynda, so often meaning the dif­ference between life and death. Only the very stupid treat them like they do not matter.

The men got up from their gambling mat. All teeth and smiles with pudgy, waterfat flesh, greeting the point riders with open arms, clasping their hands as if they were old friends.

No need to hear the words that left their lips. Their smiles weren’t fooling anyone. The ‘merchandise,’ still chained, was paraded before the riders single file.

Merchandise. My brother Flint. Had fate deposited him in this terrible place? I peered and squinted in the sun but could make out nothing. The scrawny captives had been too ill used. Too far away to make out better detail.

I lowered the glass. Iago stared intently at my face. Somehow he knew what I was thinking. He placed his hand upon my cheek. “The pilgrim trail ends sooner for some than others,” he said.

Our people did not linger. The pitiful slaves begged our riders with out­stretched arms, pleading for the turbaned desert men to take them. They knew they were done for if the men left them behind. Skinny and sick, no longer worth the waste of food and water.

“What if Flint is one of them?”

Iago grabbed my wrist and held it tight. “You can do nothing. Those men are dead already.”

“Let me go!”

“It is not wise to annoy my uncle.”

“Not wise? Is that all you can say?” Wrenching my wrist free, I jumped down to the sand. Further than it looked, I landed badly. Iago shouted words I didn’t hear.

All I cared about was Flint as I hobbled through the loose-packed sand, particles clinging to my sweaty legs. Feeling the weight of Iago’s uncle’s eyes upon my back.

The two point riders offered me stony stares. The slavers, whose grimy odour filled my nose at twenty paces, observed me with amusement. Perhaps they thought me property for sale.

“Flint!” I scanned the row of suffering wretches, most barely well enough to stand. Walked from man to man to check their thirst-pinched faces. None were his. Relief came first, then disappointment. If he were here then I could save him. We would know what had become of him, what might become of him still.

“My brother Flint walked the pilgrim trail. Have you seen him?” I asked each man in turn. Some said nothing, others answered me with jumbled, rasp­ing gasps of prayer.

It was hopeless. The slaves were close to death. I moved to stand behind the two point riders. One of them said something to the men who had been gambling. Words foreign to my ears but not theirs. Harsh, sharp words that left their mark. As we turned to leave, the leader of the slavers started cursing.

Tempers barely contained in the brittle heat. Anger that posturing and false cheer couldn’t bury. Blades were drawn. The half-starved dogs skulking around the trading post perimeter started barking up a storm. Through all this, Iago’s uncle watched in silence.

The three young boys edged close to the action, raising stones to throw just like the Noahans back in ’Piper. Fearful mothers called their names but dared not leave the safety of the tent.

We stood our ground against the gambling men. They outnumbered us and could have cut us down, but the pressure of five dragons kept them practical. Turned out they’d hoped we might buy the men for sport, or drink with them long enough to wind up drugged and robbed. Such was the way they made their coin, but Iago’s uncle never got down from his mount.

Threats were shouted across the sand and then we parted ways. “What will happen to those slaves?” I asked. Neither rider answered. We all knew what would happen to the wretches—or at least I thought we did.

I turned back just in time to see a slaver draw his sword. Snatches of angry bickering bounced upon the wind. The tongue was foreign but its nuances were not. Somebody would end up punished for this day.

Iago’s uncle stiffened in the saddle. His cloak billowed suddenly as if filled by wind only there was no wind to fill it. None at all. He reached both hands along the camel’s side to heft the thunderstick.

Bells signalled that the dragon train was lumbering into motion. A single drum setting pace for the mighty beasts.

Iago waved his hands in a flurry, anxious for me to climb atop the beast where it was safe.

But before I could move, a sound like a mighty dragon’s roar. What hap­pened next was way too fast to see: one minute there had been a shiny row of columns. The next, all that remained was belching smoke. Exclamations of surprise, but the dragons did not miss a beat.

The thunderstick rested high upon Iago’s uncle’s shoulder. The air around him sparked with flickering embers, raining to the sand like firecracker dust.

Iago shouted out my name. He fought to still his beast but the dragons were expertly trained and the bells were ringing loud and clear and true.

“Hurry—you must hurry!”

I ran to his dragon, last in line. Raised my arms and he hauled me up the saddle’s side. The thunderstick was fired again, aimed this time at the tents. Smoke cleared revealing nothing but flames and splinters.

The tent completely gone.

Slavers stumbled blindly through the sand, tripping over goats, dogs and each other. Too stunned to even curse or raise their fists.

“Your uncle planned to kill them all along,” I whispered. “You knew what was going to happen.”

Iago didn’t answer.

Dragon drovers and camel riders stared blankly at the smoke, mesmerised by its ferocity. Gaping at the pale blue sky as black roils dissolved upon the wind.

“That tent was full of women and children.”

The horror of it slowly sinking in. Suddenly it was all too much. The stench of singed flesh blended with gunpowder. The relentless ache of endless sun. The row of columns once shiny-white reduced to blackened rubble.

Iago’s dragon was on the move, but all ’Piper brats knew how to jump and roll. Someone cried out as I hit the sand. Iago, perhaps. By then it hardly mat­tered.

The sand was soft. This time I landed well and scrambled up to standing. Hurried to chase down Iago’s uncle, quickly before anyone could raise a hand. Most eyes remained on the burning mess that marked where the trading post had stood.

“You got no right!” I shrieked up at his back.

Uncle’s cloak twitched like a living skin. At last I saw it for what it was. Old tech. Pre-Ruin. Forbidden. Dangerous. Marking Iago’s uncle as a sorcerer. But it was way too late for backing down. What was started had to be completed.

“That tent was full of innocents,” I screamed.

Uncle kept his back to me. I dodged my way around his camel’s side. “You’re a coward, hiding behind that ancient reliquary. Get down off that camel now and face me.” My heart was pounding as the words flew out of me. Words that could do nothing but get me killed.

A curl of amusement touched the tall man’s lips. The intense blue of his eyes pressed down like a weight against my chest.

“They were marked for death already. All of them,” he said, his voice the deepest sound I had ever heard.

He urged his mount forward, our talking at an end. I held my ground as the dragons lumbered onwards, animals and people giving me a wide berth. Two dogs lingered, eyeing me with keen and hungry interest.

I wanted no part of any of it. The dragon train. The pilgrim trail. The sapphire city. Iago and his soft brown skin. They were all bad men and I would stand my ground until the desert claimed me—or the sun, or the sandskates, or my heart.

I didn’t get the chance. One of the point riders pulled his camel up close beside me. The beast bared its crooked teeth, leered at me with annoyance.

“Get on,” said the rider, voice muffled by a striped khafiya, his arm extended down towards my own. Iago’s friend—I had heard them talking together often enough.

I stood proud. “What if I don’t?”

“Then the vultures will eat well tonight.” He glanced at the sky, then down at the dogs. “Your bones will be picked clean before too long.”

“You cannot make me.”

What was I saying? What had I just done?

I held my ground even though my legs were shaking. So did the man in the striped khafiya. Eventually, the last of the dragons passed.

Silence lingered, heavy and complete. Dark shapes flew across the sun. Vultures, real or imaginary.

“Please,” he said. “Die before your time, if you so choose, but do not waste your death on this cursed place. Your brother, if he lives, will not thank you for it.”

There was something familiar about his eyes. Rich and brown like fresh-tilled soil. He waited past the point of mere politeness. The man was right. Pride like mine was worse than useless. Reluctantly, I gripped his arm and allowed him to haul me up into his saddle.

A blast of singed flesh and hair enveloped us as his camel galloped to catch up with the dragons. I stared at the horizon and the future that lay beyond it. Grimpiper was now as lost to me as it was to my crazy brother. I could not go back; I did not know the way. There was only forward to a city that most likely did not exist.

The sun hung heavy overhead. No shadows. No perspective. Nothing but blinding glare and burning thirst. I didn’t glance back at the ruined trading post. I couldn’t.

The rider pulled his camel alongside the smallest dragon. When my eyes met Iago’s, I saw what I had earlier failed to see. Eyes the hue of fresh-tilled soil. Iago and the camel-man were brothers.

A full day passed before Iago allowed me back up to ride behind him. Two before I was granted full forgiveness, my transgression evaporated like conden­sation on a bulging waterskin.

On the third day we passed a message scrawled upon a sun-bleached slab of stone. No words, just a diamond etched in blue. An arrow pointing to the far horizon.

Ankahmada, Ankahmada, whispered like a ward, snatched from cracked and bleeding lips, vaporised by canny, skittish winds. Beyond the rise, or the next one after that, or the next one.

We were almost out of water when a cry went up to stir my fitful saddle slumber. My eyes wide open expecting the blue of jewels. In their place, some­thing altogether stranger.

Jammed and scattered amongst the dunes the hulls of giant ships protrud­ed: bows and masts, some of iron, others warped and rotted wood, swamped and choked in tides of shifting sand. I counted fifty before my numbers left me. What would Carlina have made of this strange sight—what could anyone ever make of such a thing?

Iago’s brother had taken to riding his camel alongside Iago’s dragon. Now and then he’d smile at me when Iago wasn’t looking. One of the dogs had been bitten by a sandskate. The brother had refused to leave it, carried it tight against his chest wrapped up in the striped khafiya. He reminded me of my own brother in his courage and determination. I did not believe in Ankahmada but I was beginning to believe in Iago’s brother.

The dragons wound their way through the sand-drowned ships in single file and silence. Late afternoon brought with it the welcome half moons of shadowed dune crests, clear of wood and weld. Once more we could see where we were headed, even if we had no knowledge of where the fabled city lay. The wind grew stronger, waterskins flapping empty. We shielded our eyes and stared out across the repetitive curve and undulation of the dunes, straining for a glimpse of kite, or the speck and shadow of a lonely bird, but there was noth­ing, neither human nor animal, larger than the skeletal bugs that I imagined clinging to the spindly thorn bush stems. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Andromache and the Dragon
By Brittany Pladek
The dragon stood on the shore.

“For every day, I will consume one of your desires,” she told them. “You will not know which. You will not know whose. This is my tribute. Do you agree to its terms?”

Andromache nodded.

“Then it is done.” Hissing, the dragon arched her spines toward the sky, their nimbus peaks dissolving into vapor. Her foggy belly followed. Last she drew up her claws, their tips thinning to a sting of spray that whipped the villagers as it passed.

They shivered in the wind raised by her departure, numb hands longing for the fireplaces that lay behind them in the low houses of their fishing town. Andromache signaled that they should return home. The little group turned, heads hidden like sheep being driven up a mountain. It was suppertime, and they were all very hungry, except one.

Dragons had happened to other villages. They were as unpredictably regular as weather and sprung of the same source, bubbling muddily out of the wet earth, sizzling down from a lightning cloud, or coalescing in the dark space between raindrops. They were voracious but not picky: dragons could be bargained with. Which is why, during the meeting to prepare for its arrival — you could tell by certain cloud formations when a dragon was imminent — one villager had suggested the idea.

“Dragons eat anything. Maidens, moods, wallpaper. Why don’t we convince the dragon to eat something we don’t need?”

After much deliberation, and after eliminating eggshells, envy, fishheads, shit, rot, and ennui as either too dear to lose or too rare to satisfy the dragon’s appetite, they decided on wants.

“I want gold,” said one fisherman. “Why imagine what would happen if the dragon ate that! Piles of gold around me, as much as I wanted!”

“Which you’d share,” said his neighbor.

“. . . of course,” said the fisherman.

They chose Andromache to deliver the message, because she was one of the few literate people in the village and because no one could quite bury the suspicion that the dragon might respond better to a maiden.

“I’m a widow,” she had protested. “That’s not the same thing.”

The dragon wouldn’t know the difference, they assured her.

“And besides, don’t dragons eat maidens, not talk to them?”

No, they assured her, because she was not really a maiden.

“Oi,” she said, and went.

The persuasion was not difficult. One morning, a wet gulf opened in the hard packed sand that bordered the dunes. As Andromache dashed from her house, the coralwork webbing the depression filled with water. Each tiny arch swelled to become a silver shield. The shields became scales, and the dragon raised her head over the dunes.

“I am very empty,” she hissed toward the town.

Andromache stood at the top of the dunes, her hair damp with the dragon’s steam. She gave the ritual answer: “We have what will fill you.”

The dragon’s eyes boiled. “Are you the sacrifice?”

Andromache said: “I come to offer you a bargain. If you agree, you will never be empty again. We will give you tribute, and there will always be more. Our supply is inexhaustible.” She paused. “If I were a dragon, I would take this deal.”

The boiling quickened, and bubbles spat between the curls of the dragon’s teeth. Andromache realized she was laughing. “What do you know about dragons, human?”

“I don’t know anything about dragons,” she said. “But I do know about emptiness.” She tried to steady her gaze on swirl of burning water before her. “It consumes you. It makes you desperate.”

“You see me as desperate?” asked the dragon. “I could eat you right now.”

“You could,” Andromache said, “but I am not the tribute. You only want what you lack. Desire has rules.” Swallowing hard, she met the dragon’s eyes. “Would you never hunger again? Then take our offer.”

The boil slowed to a simmer. “Tell me,” said the dragon.

Andromache was there for the first tribute, and all the rest. Dragons are not untrustworthy, but they can be excessive. Besides, the villagers had said, as a widow Andromache had nothing better to do. She scowled, thinking of the villagers’ children, who she tutored in letters every day. But she swallowed her complaint. Dragons could not take long.

When she arrived at the beach on the third morning, a nearby clump of scrub-brush was already bowing, its dry twigs creaking as they stretched and swelled. The dragon appeared, a skeleton of branches hatched on the air. One pliant shoot curled from her mouth like a tongue, sniffing.

“Why are you still here, human?” she asked, looking sideways at Andromache. “We have made our pact.”

“I’m interested,” said Andromache.

“Hrm,” the dragon replied. Her long tongue flickered higher. With a crackle, her splintery jaws widened and her throat undulated with swallowing. The dragon finished her first mouthful, and the sour brown of her scale-leaves seemed to soften. A sated sigh rippled the branches cradling her belly.

Andromache stepped forward so she was in the dragon’s line of sight. “What do desires taste like?” she asked.

The dragon’s eye, a single gleaming berry, turned towards her. “You see,” she continued, “we—I — only feel wants. I can only know what I desire and desire it. I have no sense for its flavors, its complexities. But you will taste all of ours.” The eye did not turn. “I am curious about the difference.”

Dragons do not smile, but the thicket of that massive body flared its twigs for a moment. The dragon lowered her head to reveal a second berry of deep sea green.

“What do you want, human?”

“I —”

With a dart like a sparrow, the dragon’s tongue flicked out and danced over the crown of Andromache’s head.

“Your need tastes like emptiness,” she rumbled, “like the crumbled soil in the hole where a tree has been uprooted, or the ache of a missing limb.” Her eyes glowed. “Do you know this need, human?”

Andromache stared back. The old loss rose through her limbs like blood, and her shoulders straightened as they always did, with almost the same vigor as she had felt when her husband had held them, a long time ago. “I know it,” she said quietly.

Raising her head, the dragon rustled her body in approval, each slim twig quaking with what Andromache guessed was laughter.

“You do!” she said. “How unusual. You are a step ahead of your fellows. They do not know what they want, and so they do not know when I have taken it.”

“That can’t be true.”

“It is.”

“I spoke with one yesterday,” Andromache continued, “and the child she will bear has made her happier than anything ever could.”

The dragon laughed again, rustling. “Not all desires are so simple,” she said. “Even if your friend’s child had been that day’s tribute.”

“Then what —”

But the dragon’s tongue had flicked up again, and her jaw’s branches were unlacing. As she lifted her nose, the lattice of her chest bellied outwards, and her pliant throat undulated. She seemed to drink — not one sip this time, but long full draughts. A tender green blushed the dry leaves of her scales. Andromache watched in silence as the drab, parched fingers of the scrub brush plumped with a satiety they had never known. The bare branches of the dragon’s ribs clouded with leaves; her tail and muzzle flashed in flowers that curled immediately into berries. On the grey beach washed with grey waves she stood on the sand, a hymn of light and color, a singing forest, complete unto herself.

After the final draught, the dragon turned again to Andromache. Her head hung with eyes. “I am full,” she said in a voice of leaves and water. “Will you come again, human?”

For a long moment, Andromache stared at her many shining eyes. Then she said, “I will.”

Every day the dragon condensed on the shore; every day her form differed. She accrued like the tide-line, inevitably but much swifter, blossoming into graceful sculptures of sand, grass, sun, and air. On one memorable morning she slithered out of high tide, a flashing boil of minnows and water; on another, she unfurled as a fierce wind that feathered itself in the gummy, discarded plumage of the gulls. On countless others she burbled slimily from the deep, her green muck studded brilliantly with the luminescent inhabitants of the depths. Andromache had not known there were so many creatures on earth or in heaven. As she sat with her tutees in their dark houses, rehearsing lines of verse by candlelight, she often found her eyes straying towards the shore.

One morning she arrived on the beach to find the dragon already there waiting. She had not eaten yet. Today her body was a white mat of filaments, a thick mesh lashed to the sand by countless tiny threads. The deflated bodies of mushrooms hung here and there like limp scales from the gossamer. The dragon was spun, Andromache realized, from the diaphanous fungal roots that spread silently within all decay.

With a wormy shudder the dragon’s head unrooted itself. “I did not think you would come today,” she said.

“Sorry,” Andromache said, catching her breath. She had run. “The boy I am tutoring had not done his reading, so I had to stay and explain it to him. The parents of these children always expect me to stay longer. They think I have nothing else important to do,” she added bitterly. The dragon’s eyes widened in a manner Andromache had come to associate with confusion. “Don’t mind me,” she sighed. “I am just grumpy because I don’t feel appreciated.”

“Appreciated?”

“Yes. It is a little silly. I’m old and widowed, and I should not expect thanks.”

The pale head drifted closer. “What is ‘appreciated’?”” asked the dragon.

“Oh!” said Andromache. “It is a little difficult to explain. Appreciation is when — when you are glad something is there. Imagine you came to the beach one morning and there was nothing for you to eat. You would feel the absence, yes?”

“Yes,” the dragon said.

“Now contrast that with how you feel when you arrive and the air is full of desires.” Saturated was how the dragon had described the town on a holiday morning. “You miss them when they are not there, and you appreciate them when they are.” The grey eyes watched her intently. “Now imagine those desires miss you, too. When you return, they are happy because you are there. Humans are like that, sometimes. We appreciate one another.”

The dragon lay her head down on the sand. Her gossamer eyes flickered thoughtfully. “This is strange,” she said. “It is like wanting, but the want is to be wanted.”

“Humans are strange,” Andromache said. She watched the dragon’s mouth, which still made no motion towards eating. “Have you tasted that desire, that wanting to be wanted? What does it taste like?” she asked.

“I have not,” the dragon replied. “I cannot choose my meals.” Then she continued, slowly, “If I do, I will describe its taste to you. You will — appreciate that.”

The withered mushrooms hanging from the dragon’s body seemed faintly to freshen. Watching, Andromache felt strange. She bent forward to lay the fingertips of one hand on the sand, so that they just pressed the edge of the dragon’s mycelial mat. “I will!” she said. “Thank you. That is what humans say when they feel appreciated.”

The dragon repeated, “Thank you.” The tendrils of her muzzle spread further outward, coiling beneath Andromache’s fingers. They felt soft and warm, and through them ran a low pulse like a cat’s purr. Her lacework body sunk placidly on the sand.

Time passed. Andromache said, “You should probably eat.”

“Yes,” said the dragon. “Thank you.”

In the town, things were very different, though no one could quite say how. Everyone knew the dragon had something to do with it, but only a few people could point to a specific instance of a desire that had been lost. And even then, there was no way of knowing whether the dragon was responsible. Some, like the fisherman who no longer wanted gold, chose to think that they had matured beyond such material concerns. Others preferred to blame god, or the neighbors. One fisherwoman who had not eaten for two weeks rebuffed her husband faintly: “I’m not hungry.” A dyer with four daughters opted to believe the town’s sudden interest in his wares was due to their belated appreciation of his taste, not his unuttered worry for his children.

There was no single means whereby their wants disappeared. One villager had pined for a wife and received twelve cats, with whom he was perfectly happy. Another stopped bathing after she found no real compulsion to remain clean.

Still another, a baby, died quietly in her mother’s arms. She no longer wished to live.

All in all, the villagers were satisfied with the arrangement. They had to be. As for the dragon, she was filled anew every day, as promised.

“How many emptinesses you have,” she murmured to Andromache as they sat together on the shore.

One morning, perhaps three weeks later, the dragon rose out of the surf as a fluorescent cliff of seasnails. Andromache was already waiting. As the dragon coalesced, she shaded her eyes from the light scattered by the dragon’s body. Each bright snail was encased in a glassy shell, a thousand miniature prisms whose facets poured back sunlight as the dragon moved. Two fronds of seaweed served as eyes, dark streaks on the dragon’s face that gave the impression of weeping.

Before tasting the air, the dragon greeted Andromache, as she did each day now.

Andromache could barely focus on the dragon’s form, which gleamed like a kaleidoscope. Marveling at the fierce whorl of color, she asked a question she had wondered about for a while now: “Why is your body always made of something else?”

The dragon’s kelp eyes shivered. “I am not sure I can explain it to you,” she said.

“Try.”

The dragon lay her great head down, so that the pile of seasnails and their weeping eyes were parallel to Andromache’s face. “Think about your — husband,” she began, struggling to recall the word.

Puzzled, Andromache obeyed. She did not often recall him actively. His memory was always with her, a deep marrow of pain and gratitude, and sometimes if she let herself grow still, in those moments she felt their past’s quiet circulation. He had died many years ago. But his death was like the submerging of a spring where water still flowed, invisible and vital.

“Ah,” said the dragon. Her tongue, a slim antenna, was tasting the space before Andromache’s eyes. “You feel this emptiness, and it pains you. But you are human, so you collect around it. Your desire centers you. It is need, but it is also life.”

The tongue licked backwards. “Dragons are different. We have no center, only want.” Her wet eyes seemed to tremble. “Perhaps that is because we are only want. My body is always multiple because my desires are. I have no center.”

Though dragons do not feel sadness, Andromache had the sudden urge to stroke the glistening mass of sea creatures. Reaching out, she laid her hand on the dragon’s knobby cheek, just below where the kelp eyes wept softly down.

But at her touch, the dragon jerked her head away from the sand. A few tiny seasnails chipped from her jaw and fell to the ground, writhing as their crystal shells snapped. Her tongue lifted towards the town. “I am very empty today,” she burbled, as if in apology. More seasnails shattered as her mouth stretched open; today it was less like a muzzle and more like a sinkhole whose muddy sides had collapsed.

“Eat,” Andromache urged. “I’m sorry. I will not try to touch you again.”

The dragon’s jaws pulsed like a wound. “No. It is not — ” A shudder passed up her glassy body. “Will you come tomorrow, Andromache?”

“Yes.”

The dragon’s head swayed. Sunlight splashed through its many prisms and then fell away again, charged with color. She was very hollow, Andromache thought, and very beautiful. “Please,” she said, “Eat.”

“Thank you,” said the dragon.

Some time later, Andromache found herself alone on the beach. Beside her, a slick of steaming sand ran like a scar back towards the water. She was unable to recall precisely why she had lingered there. Shaking her head, she returned to town.

A young boy who had been out gathering clams further down the beach claims he saw the dragon’s departure. She looked, he said, like no dragon he had ever seen: a sleek, solid coil of lizard scales and fire, hooked wings beating the shallows to fury as she rose, howling, into the sky. Nature had no part of her; sea and sand recoiled from her touch. In the town, the villagers heard her scream and trembled.

Here is what it tasted like.

It tasted like dependence, the fixture of roots in a riverbank whose vulnerability twines them together. It tasted like affirmation, the shout of metal as it finds its magnet. It tasted like apocalypse, the collapse of life’s clamor into a pattern clear and sharp as music. Savoring that day’s anonymous desire, the dragon was surprised to find herself within, like an image suspended in a mirror. With gratitude and recognition, she drank deeply of her own reflection. She tasted what it was to be wanted.

It was utterly satisfying and unspeakably painful.

The next day, Andromache did not go down to the seashore. Nor did she return the following day, nor the next, nor any of those afterwards.

The villagers said nothing, but they were quietly relieved. Despite their mistrust of the dragon, they had grown more suspicious still of Andromache’s intimacy with her. It was unnatural, they said, for a single woman to be so long away from company. Didn’t she have better things to do? What did she and the beast talk about for all those idle hours? It was unseemly, they agreed, for a widow to spend so much time in company — especially the company of a dragon.

Andromache fielded their complaints with her usual mild unconcern. She did not know why she had decided to stop visiting the dragon. It simply no longer pleased her. She did not feel she owed anyone an explanation. Each morning, after her teaching was finished, instead of walking to the shore she went wandering in the hills, sitting for long, still hours beside the streams’ dark music. She thought often of her husband. By most standards, she was content. And if her serenity was not precisely complete, she could never name the source of her unease.

The dragon left a week later. The first few mornings after Andromache’s absence she had appeared on the beach, crashing down in scaled glory to alight on sand her heat turned instantly to glass. After a few minutes of waiting she left again, keening. She did not feed. Eventually she stopped coming, and the glass slick she left behind turned its perfect mirror to an empty sky.

The villagers were delighted. No dragon had ever abandoned a town before. They felt, proudly, that they had defeated this one. A town mythology slowly developed claiming collective responsibility for their singular triumph. Andromache’s name was not mentioned, though afterwards the parents of her tutees were no longer quite as insistent in their demands on her time.

Like the dragon herself, the consumed desires never returned. The dyer’s children prospered, and the fisherwoman died peacefully of starvation. New petty jealousies arose to replace those that had been taken. The town returned to business as usual. They watched the clouds for more dragons.

Once in a while they heard tales of distant towns razed by a terrifying serpent, a monstrous reject of nature — winged, fire-breathing, and ruthless, crazed with insatiable hunger. But it never came to their village. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Labyrinth, Sanctuary
By A.E. Prevost
Constance carves her timeworn tracks into the thirsty rock. With silent steps her footfalls smooth the stone, century into century, grooves and gullies growing green as time and seed take hold. Stone after stone, her hands build battlements and balconies, repair time-ragged trusses, stack spires towards the sun. Deep in the dark wood, with every aching year, her sanctuary spreads its restless roots.

Constance dreams of colonnades and courtyards, crafts finials from fingernails, weaves tapestries from hair. She climbs her spiral stairs into the storm-bruised sky, flings open feverish arms against the thrum of thunder, batters the balustrades with fists like driving rain. Constance lets rage run through her like the roiling storm, then huddles in the hollows and scratches broken nails across the thirsty roots that thrive between the cracks. So long as she keeps building, she is safe. Her moss-laced maze mirrors the spirals in her soul, and she repeats her one and only truth: in this, her sanctuary, no ill thing can befall her.

The poet’s path bruises the grass under their ash-grim boots. A hunger howls behind them, spreading fast, a wildfire that feeds on hope and spits out fear like smoke. With sea-green scarf wrapped fast against their face, they fill their mouth and nose with flowers and song, and walk into the woods, and do not rest. The poet’s heart enshrines the memory of colours; an ocean coils within, wine-dark and dormant, which pulses in their throat with every step.

There was an ocean, once; the poet walked its coast and paddled in its pearl-kissed waters, trading tales with sirens, learning the songs of stars. Children with laughter bright as birds called them cousin, and families fished feasts of colour from the swelling waves, repeating recipes whispered by the sea winds. The poet plucked gem-hued fruit from swaying shoreline trees, with names they tasted in the juices on their tongue, and flowers sprung from where their bare feet met the fertile ground.

The fruit trees, too, have fallen now. All colours are consumed; all names are ash. Only the poet remains, steadfast, song-laden. Their loping strides track sea salt onto the forest floor.

The wall juts up among the trees, tangled with roots, jagged and ancient. The poet stops, panting through sea-green silk, brushing their sea-browned hand against the crumbling stone. Songs tell of a labyrinth here in these lands, long-haunted, ill-advised; the poet knows there must be a path through it, for there is a path through all places, in time. The hunger howls in the dust-ridden distance. The poet raises reddened eyes and meets the gaze of a stranger.

The stranger steps back, blending into the shadows. The poet presses close against the wall, peering through the crack where they just saw the woman wreathed in vines and leaves.

Ahoy inside, the poet calls. Are you a prisoner? Or are you lost inside the labyrinth?

I am Constance, the stranger says, her voice a wraith among the whispering trees. I am not lost, and I am not imprisoned. I am Constance.

I am Daylily, the poet says, kneeling beside the barrier. An ocean’s worth of memories weighs heavy on my back. A hunger hurries behind me to consume the world – all wonder, colour, hope, all life, and love itself. Long I lived as a petal, borne on a breeze, but now the wind that drives me reeks of waste and ruin. Will you reveal to me the passage through this labyrinth?

This is no labyrinth, Constance replies. She finds her strength steadily as she speaks. No, this is no labyrinth, stranger, any more than I am lost. A thousand years I’ve travailed in these woods, and set down every stone with my own hands. No harm can hunt me in my sanctuary. This place is safe from that which seeks you, too.

Soon there will be no sanctuary to be had, Daylily objects. Ash has covered the colours of the land, undone the sea, and quenched the stars. Ash has filled the mouths and eyes of everyone I’ve known.

Constance approaches the split between the stones, picks at her side of it with dirty fingers. The poet’s eyes beyond are proud, night-dark and pleading.

I see your sorrow, stranger, but you should not fear. These halls are strong, and here no fire will find us.

The poet’s eyes burn bright behind the break.

Wanderer, if you wish, Constance whispers, you could remain, secure behind my stones. There’s room to spare within my sanctuary.

Daylily reaches to Constance through the gap, their hands barely brushing.

Immortal architect, fleeing is all I have left, for if I am forgotten, so will be every hope once set in song. I beg you, now. I must pursue my path and travel through this place, or perish when the hunger reaches us.

Constance traces the tree-like whorls of Daylily’s fingertip with a feather-soft touch. Strange, the skin of another, sinew and rushing blood, blue-dyed nails, coarse hair. Strange, the shiver that ghosts along a bare arm at her breath. Strange, the distant drumming of a heart held fast in a fortress of flesh, a cage of bone. Strange, the smell of flowers and the sea.

Enter then, Constance says. Flee and be safe.

For the first time in a thousand years, a stranger stands on sanctuary stone. Constance collects small pebbles from the ground and stacks and restacks them in even piles. Daylily looks towards the forest line, past which their doom draws ever nearer, then down across the dark expanse of stone that winds and stretches out within the walls. Intentioned or not, a thousand years of building has birthed something well-served with the word Labyrinth.

I should continue quickly on my way, Daylily says. What path through is the fastest?

Constance pauses, a pebble in her hand. Thistles and thorns are threaded through her hair.

There is no map, she says, no method here but the one deep within my mind. But I can take you, I can, I know the way. Only I can show you out.

Daylily looks to her eager eyes, and nods.

Daylily’s boots follow Constance’s bare feet. The sun dips low, sending spears of copper through the cool dark trees. The labyrinth is floors and walls and stairs, but rooms throughout lie open to the sky; Daylily breathes in birdsong, dusk, and pollen, weaving its precious world into a poem.

What is it that you whisper as we walk? Constance asks. Often your breath is bound together with words I barely hear.

There is so little life left in the world, Daylily says. I must protect the poetry of it, wherever I can. Else my survival would have been in vain.

Constance runs her fingers along the familiar railing, her road drawing her deeper into the fortress.

Your survival saved you, she remarks. Even if you remembered nothing, that alone would be worth all your worry.

Do not say that! Daylily draws their features into a frown. Do not say that, Constance. I was a petal; I was never a stone. I was never meant to last, only to float like flotsam on the surface of the wave, my gaze turned gently to the dreaming deep. I was, and remain, nothing. Do not say that my survival alone is worth more than the memories I bear.

I do not think I said that, Constance says, stepping over a tree root in their way. But perhaps both have value. Yes, perhaps.

Daylily follows quietly in her wake.

The sickle moon shines silver light onto the columned court.

We should rest here a while, Constance suggests. There is a bed of ferns and feathers near where we can pass the night.

I have not slept since the hunger began, Daylily replies.

Does it follow so close? Constance asks, looking for the nest built long ago.

I fear sleep will devour my devotion, Daylily admits, and make me forget the folk whose songs I sing, or lead the desolation right into my dreams.

Well I have no such worries, Constance says from a soft-shadowed alcove. She stretches out her limbs and rests her head on ancient bird wings tied with red-dyed roots, and proposes they pause their travel until daybreak.

For one night, perhaps, Daylily presumes their quest can wait. Alone, they wander awake between the vine-wreathed pillars; they fill their eyes with infinite shimmering stars, their ears with the calls of cricket, owl, and frog. Under the milky moonlight, Daylily murmurs to remember, and Constance is lulled to sleep by their soft litany.

The dawn paints pink coral blooms on Constance’s cheeks and sets fire to the halo of Daylily’s hair. Birds with scarlet-tipped feathers follow them, hopping from stone to stone, from arch to arch.

Will you teach me a song from your life by the sea? Constance requests, ambling abreast with Daylily. We have a way to walk still before you leave, and I have no songs of my own save the sounds woven by the wilderness.

The wilderness is splendid in its song, Daylily says. I could listen a century and still be wanting.

You could stay, Constance says. Put roots down in the woodlands for a while. When your hunger comes, my walls can withstand it. Nothing will make ash of us in here.

Daylily faces forward, steadfast and unforgiving. They walk in silence down the winding stair.

Truly, Daylily says, your sanctuary is spectacular.

Constance gathers loose gravel, lays it aside for later at the angles of hallways.

Most of the time, now, I reuse what crumbles, she says. But sometimes I dig deeper in the rock and bring out a new boulder with which to build.

And you have truly done this for a thousand years? Daylily asks.

Your hunger is behind you, Constance says. It chases you. Mine is within. It waits for me in quiet moments, in my belly, breathless. Its patience is perfect. Building keeps it at bay.

And you have never left, not once, in all this time?

In leaving, I would lose all I have made, Constance mutters, scratching her skin against the stone. My castle would crumble, and I would surely turn into dust, dissolve, and drift away.

I would not want you to dissolve, Daylily says. But if you could escape this place, perhaps we could travel together. I would hate for the hunger to consume you, drain your dreams from the world, wither your vines. I would hate for a thousand years of stories to be swept into ash.

Constance crouches and straightens out the little stacks of slate that line the edges of the pin-straight path. She only rises once the stacks are straight, and turns to her companion rather than check again.

I am more than stories, and so are you.

Daylily looks away, into the dappled light cast through the canopy of towering trees.

Daylily, Constance asks without approaching, will you teach me one of the ocean’s songs? By nightfall we will near the end of my expanse, and you will flee, and I will remain rooted in my fortress. I ask you this one kindness in exchange for seeing you through my sanctuary. Do not leave me songless and on my own.

Silence stretches between them like a thread, spider silk, shivering in the breeze.

I do not sing, Daylily says, their face turned towards the forest. I did, before, when I lived freely among friends, the ocean churning out new canticles with every crashing wave. Our fables flowed, easy as breath, through child and fruit and star, and we stitched stories into fish scales, told tales on wax-printed fabrics, dyed sand to sketch sagas into the beach, triumphant and then vanished with the tide. Easy as breathing, in and out, a beauty borne by all of us together, new stories spreading like wildfire down the coast, blooming in different colours on each vine, and then releasing seeds upon the wind.

But only I remain now, and I fear that if I share the songs that I have learned, I will lose them forever. And my family, my ocean, my stars and flowers will fade, leaving me empty. One day, perhaps, I will find an apprentice, and pass my tales along for another to carry. One day, perhaps, I will be ready to be nothing once again, and to die. But until then I collect, and flee, and do not sleep or sing.

Constance remains a moment, then relents, guiding the poet onwards through a narrow arch and up a passage to a parapet, a path that overlooks the vine-encrusted woods.

It seems a pity, she says, at the top, that such thriving songs should stay bottled within you. To hear you say it, a large part of their beauty was the way the poems passed from breath to breath, from heart to heart. If you keep them inside, is that not hollow? Is that not how the hunger itself behaves?

I am nothing like the hunger, Daylily states.

Yet you believe yourself empty and worthless, Constance says. Save for the songs that you deny the world.

I’m not the hunger!

Then prove it, wandering poet. Sing for me.

Daylily kicks their boots off and faces her, brow feverish, feet rooted to the rock. They pull their sea-green scarf down from their face, revealing a strong nose and blue-dyed lips. Behind them in the sky clouds darken, their clotting shadows covering the day.

The sky draws close, yearning for devastation, draining the colour from the trees. The birds go quiet, blotted out by the questing silence. Behind Daylily, the blanketing moss dries up and the ferns shrivel. Constance chokes on dust and watches rivulets of ash race across the stone towards her like spring thaw.

Daylily, she says, Daylily, sing.

It begins with a single hummed note hovering between them, timid and intangible as hope itself. The hunger pauses, a predator taking a breath before descending on its death-marked prey. Daylily feels its breathing on their back, dry, thirsting. Tears fall as they close their eyes and find their voice.

The poet’s song starts soft but quickly grows into a symphony of colour: sapphire and tourmaline, topaz, carnelian, white sand-caressing waves and sweet sun-ripened red. Their words litter the ground like leaves, hover over Constance’s skin like hummingbirds, thunder against her fortress like a flood. Constance’s heart beats ruby-dark and rushes warmth through her. She takes a step towards the singer, hand outstretched, and the creeping ash shrinks back.

Fish flit like dragonflies in the gem-clear shallows, reflecting sunlight on their rainbow scales.

Constance’s fingers touch Daylily’s hand. Beneath the poet’s bare feet, sprouts spring up, new green twining around their toes. Constance hums the tune she hears, in halting echoes that turn into harmonies.

Children stack shells into a shiny game, gathered by size and colour, counting their collection as they win and lose.

Constance’s dress of vines writhes and awakens, flora erupting up her thighs and flanks, cascading down her shoulders in a mantle of morning glories and pea blossoms. Sunlight and gentian gather in her hair.

Strong arms lay out baskets of sweet sun-baked berries, sea-salted leaves, round thumb-sized roots boiled and seasoned with spices, sugar wine. Barrels of seaweed and whisper-thin white fish, fermenting to be reborn as broth.

Daylily holds on to Constance’s hands, Constance’s voice. They turn to face the howling hunger together, pouring an ocean of stories down its throat as saplings spring up around them on the parapet. Crawling nasturtium vines chase ash from stone, bursting open in sunset-scarlet blooms against the grey.

Elders gather from up and down the coast, bringing a pot-luck of plates cooked by grandchildren and great-grandchildren and great friends. In the firelight they forget their differences, sing songs of storms that only they survived, laugh at old jokes, rekindle relationships long since burned down to embers. They watch stars that have wandered far longer than them, and that will still fill the night when they’re forgotten.

Constance and Daylily face down the dust, hands clasped. A crack of thunder punctuates their song. Exhilarated rain ruptures the sky, sinks into their garments as warm as love, and waters their growing garden. Rain rinses ash away and replaces it with roots, rushing throughout the sanctuary and beyond to erupt and scream out in greens and reds and yellows. Birds nest in newborn trees, sheltered from the rioting rain, and each drop on their plumage echoes a song of the ocean, which they weave into their own.

Under the bright and noisy canopy of the wide woods, deer raise their russet heads, and ring-tailed rodents leap to lower branches. Constance can see the whole of it laid out, the triumphs and struggles of life being lived beyond the boundaries of her home. In the clearing distance, as the ash recedes, a glimmering line of light traces the end of the land. And bright as a dream, along the sparkling shore, she sees elders laugh around fires, children count shells, bright-patterned figures gather garnet-glowing fruit. She squeezes Daylily’s hand as the hunger fades and flees – for now. There is so much there, in the world beyond. Perhaps there will be time to see it all. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Franken-Puppy
By Derek Künsken
In the third yard, the puppy darted a suspicious look back at its tail. Then, as if remembering what he’d been doing, he swung his head forward, panted, and sat in the grass. Beyond the ratty picket fence, patched skyscrapers stood in the hazy blue distance like uneven teeth. The puppy delighted himself with a high bark. The red bricks of the house behind him were re-mortared, but straight. The puppy’s tail thumped the ground. He lay down, rolled onto his back, then looked at her, barking as his tail resumed thumping. Child fingers — some bright pink, others brown, sewn with tiny stitches to a strong dark hand — brushed wonderingly at the soft fur before wriggling and tickling.

“Who’s a good boy?” Francesca said.

The puppy stretched, then playfully wrapped his paws over her wrist and nipped at the tough skin with teething canines. Francesca giggled and yanked her hand away. The puppy yipped and followed her fingers, his swinging tail swaying his whole body. Two skinny arms, scarred and mismatched, lifted and hugged him. Her brown hair brushed the top of the puppy’s head. The puppy wriggled a bit, his tail stilling. One arm was across his belly and one was under his snout. He struggled uncertainly, his mouth opening wide.

“I love you sooooo much!” Francesca said, eyes closed, cheek against the softness of his head as she hugged him with all the love in her revivified heart. A snap sounded and the puppy stopped struggling. She loosened her grip. The puppy was limp.

“Mommy!” Francesca wailed.

“Oh no!” her mother said from the kitchen doorway. “Francie, I told you to be careful with real puppies! Dennis! It happened again!”

“This is the fourth one!” Melanie said. “Why do you keep getting the cheap ones?”

Dennis stood in the middle of the kitchen, a trail of oily steps leading from the garage behind him. His gray shirt was clean, buttoned to the bolts on his neck, sleeves ripped off at the shoulder seam, leaving his wiry, mismatched arms showing.

“Puppies aren’t cheap!”

Melanie eyed him skeptically from under hair piled into a dark beehive.

“Mommy!” Francie pleaded. She sat teary-eyed at the table, the plastic straw spearing her unsipped Mummy’s Curse juice box. Melanie wiped Francie’s tears with her palm.

“Puppies are filthy anyway!” Melanie said. “We might as well build a dog!”

“Don’t be crude in front of Francie, dear.”

Francie tugged on Melanie’s arm.

“Mommy. No! Pleeeeeease. I want a puppy, not a big grown dog!”

Melanie watched Dennis defiantly. “Why don’t you build one?” she said.

“Sew an animal? Don’t say adult stuff in front of Francie!”

Melanie’s muscled shoulders, both pale with a slight grayish tinge, slumped a bit.

“What happened to us, Dennis? We were wild once.”

Dennis waved his arms at the kitchen, with its neat skeleton wallpaper, linoleum flooring, range and stove, and big white fridge with its polished femur-bone handle.

“We grew up. We’ve made a good life!”

“You changed, Dennis.”

“What does that mean? You want me to build a puppy?”

“Yes!”

They glared at each other as Francie looked from one to the other, one hand gripped tight in Melanie’s apron frills.

“I didn’t change!” Dennis said, stabbing his thumb at his chest. “I’ll build a damn puppy!”

“Yay!” Francie said.

Roshni was peeking over Dennis’s fence, straining her neck to better see the crackling blue welding light spilling from the garage into the evening. Roshni came to the foot of the driveway, then to the garage door. Two hanging bulbs lit dusty benches scattered with parts and tools. Roshni straightened her name tag. She smoothed her hair over a wide, hairless skin graft reaching almost to the crown of her head. Dennis was forcing the tip of the welder into small metal cervical joints, his welding mask lifted high so he could better see.

“Is that a dog skeleton?” Roshni said.

Dennis started, spinning to block the view with his body. The welder dropped. So did one of the metal legs attached to what looked like a spine.

“What? No! Hi, Roshni. How’s Suresh?” Dennis flushed.

“Don’t be embarrassed. I’m with the Frankensteiner church.”

Roshni picked up the leg from the floor and handed it to Dennis.

“Is your wife upset you’re building a dog?”

Dennis took the stiff skeletal limb, his fingers tracing nervous lines on it.

“She, uh . . . she experimented with xeno-grafts in college,” Dennis said carefully. “Just for medical research, of course.”

Awkwardly, Dennis turned to test the torque on a silver drill.

“Have you thought of letting Frankenstein into your heart?” Roshni said. “The Sewn Baptismal Church of Frankenstein opens its—”

“Look, I really have to build a puppy. I’d appreciate it if you kept this quiet. I didn’t tell anybody about that thing in your pool.”

Dennis positioned the drill bit against a metal vertebra. Roshni scratched at skin flaking around the bolts in her neck. Dennis’s muscles bunched as he leaned into the spinning drill. Steel shavings peeled off. It looked like the drill was going to get through and maybe pierce his hand when the vibrations shook off another leg.

“It’s so transgressive!” Roshni said, admiring Dennis’s work.

“We’ll keep it inside. No one will know,” Dennis said distractedly.

“Are you sure you don’t already believe in the Frankenstein?”

Dennis selected a long, crooked needle threaded with old electrical wiring and tried to figure out how to sew the fallen leg back into the joint where the weld had broken.

“You can make a puppy-sized body out of steel, but it’ll short circuit during the revival process,” Roshni said.

Dennis eyed her.

“My father sewed me together himself at night after the other factory workers went home. He taught me how to sew.”

Dennis lowered the needle and leaned the two-legged dog skeleton against the wall.

“Melanie and I killed fresh humans to make Francie. We sewed and electrified her together.” He looked at the needle and repurposed wire. “Now we seem to be angry a lot.”

“You made your own daughter with the same process the creator used to make the first sewn people. Why are you an atheist?”

Dennis put on his reading glasses and examined the hip joint.

“Come see the sanctity of the Frankenstein.”

“I have to build a puppy,” Dennis said.

He succeeded in forcing the needle through the small steel hole, but then the spine snapped. It all collapsed. Roshni touched Dennis’s arm.

“I’ll help you.”

Dennis and Roshni drove to the human town outside the city in a rust-colored Streamliner with a broken windshield. The sun shone bright as they pulled up to the high wooden palisade surrounding the settlement. Humans in the fields scattered. Dogs barked. Pitchforks and torches were brandished defiantly at the gates. Dennis stepped out, balancing coffee, sunglasses, and keys as dogs retreated.

“They must have sturdy dogs here,” Dennis said as they walked toward the gates.

“Anything not sewn breaks pretty easily,” Roshni said.

A human threw a torch.

The dogs cowered and tried to slink away from Dennis. He handed his coffee to Roshni and bent to examine one of them. He felt at its internal organs. The dog flinched and yelped and scrambled to run. Dennis let it.

“Even adult dogs are flimsy. Maybe if I sewed two together . . .” Dennis surveyed the pack still barking. “Grow stronger dogs!” he yelled at the humans. He took his coffee.

“Maybe check the free-range humans?” he said to Roshni. “Their dogs might be tougher?”

It seemed like a futile hope.

“Do you honestly believe one of these made us?” Dennis said, gesturing at the cowering humans.

“That’s why they call it a miracle.”

Dennis took one of Roshni’s forearms, looking at it through his reading glasses.

“This might make a good puppy foot.”

Roshni pulled away her arm.

“The church and law say the same thing: only sew with human parts. The sewn are sanctified because we have intelligence, but . . .” Roshni began whispering “. . . we’ve made some re-live animals.”

Dennis swatted Roshni’s arm.

“Pervert.”

“They’re at the freak show at the Bible Camp. Do you want to see?”

“Only perverts go to freak shows.”

One dog came close, barked loud enough to scare itself, and ran off.

“Yes,” Dennis said.

The sign above the driveway said: The Sewn Baptismal Church of Frankenstein. A number of buildings with off-white siding and cheap windows ringed a small lake with rickety boats, a listing dock, and a new volleyball net. Everyone was dressed like Roshni. Black slacks, white shirt, and collar with the sleeves torn, and name tags. Men had added black polyester ties. A group of sewn children were playing a game under the supervision of overly cheerful teens with whistles. A wooden effigy of Frankenstein stood in the middle of the camp.

“Capture the flag around statues to mythical humans to bring spiritual enlightenment?” Dennis said. “Really?”

“We’re a fully experimental Bible Camp!”

They walked past the grass parking lot, to a fair tent with a sun-beaten wooden sign that said Freak Show. Dennis peeked his head inside and whistled. Roshni looked in, grinning with pride. Big wooden tables lined the perimeter of the tent, stacked to bending with big jars of formaldehyde and floating animal specimens, many of which were sewn together.

“Imagine if we could recover lost arts, remake legendary monsters!” Roshni said.

Dennis bent close to a jar of preserved piglets, each sewn from pieces in a symphony of mismatches.

“No one knows you’ve been sewing animals?”

“We don’t want bad press,” Roshni said, “but if we brought back a real monster, who’s going to argue with our methods?”

“Wait a minute!” Dennis said. “They don’t have bolts. None have been electrified. They’re just corpses with swapped parts!”

Roshni looked sheepish.

“Trial and error. We need your help. You need ours.”

“So, you don’t know how to make puppies.”

Dennis stormed out of the tent.

“We want to! We really want to!” Roshni called after him.

Melanie lay in bed, propped on pillows, wearing a sheer night gown that revealed her many seams and scars. Dennis paced under the bare lightbulb. Wolves howled at a full moon.

“They didn’t know anything, Mel! Their freak show was a joke.”

“Freak show?”

He leaned on the windowsill, looking out at Roshni’s stupid pool, now filled with dirt. Melanie put a hand on his back.

“What kind of idiot walks around with a name tag?”

“What freak show?” she asked.

“They just want to look scandalous to get converts to feel dangerous.”

He turned. They were very close. She curled a finger around one of his bolts.

“Tell me you’re going to sew animals,” she breathed in his ear.

He pulled the cord on the bulb, leaving just the moonlight.

“I’m going to sew animals.”

“You’re such a monster!” she teased.

Their silhouettes merged.

Dennis hadn’t put on his tie. Melanie was still in her housecoat with her hands on his shoulders. He noted the latest answer from his calculator on the sheaves of paper laying on the table. Francie poured milk on her Mummy-Os cereal.

“There’s still too much resistance for the puppy’s body to take a full charge,” Dennis said. “It’ll cook.”

“You can’t do it?” Melanie said.

“Only a full-sized dog body could take revival voltage.”

“Daaaaddy! I want a puppy!”

“The grafting specimens gave me some ideas though,” he said.

“If we go to church, can I see the freak show?” Melanie asked.

“The Baptist church?”

“We’ll call it date night.”

“I don’t want date night at church.”

“Yes, you do.”

Francie giggled, not understanding. She watched her mother look strangely at her father, and then finally whisper in his ear. His expression became increasingly shocked.

“What are you saying, Mommy? Mommy, what are you saying?”

Dennis patted Francie’s hand. “Quiet honey. Mommy has some good ideas about . . . puppy-making.”

“Yay!” Francie said.

The clapboard walls of the church looked damaged and repaired and damaged and repaired. The sturdy pews had solid braces where pieces had been fixed. A painting of Victor Frankenstein glowered down from behind the pulpit. The pews filled with bare-armed, sewn people in their Sunday best. To the side was a confessional booth, and at the back stood tables stacked with pamphlets on “Letting Frankenstein into Your Heart.” A beaming Roshni pressed one into each of their hands.

“I feel silly,” Dennis whispered. “There wasn’t really a Frankenstein.”

“When do we see the monstrosities?” she whispered.

“See the paintings of the Igors and Draculas and wolfmans?” Roshni said. “Imagine if we could remake the angelic beings who helped the Frankenstein.”

“Some date night,” Dennis whispered.

A sewn man in robes mounted the pulpit. Dennis didn’t know many of the scriptural words, but the congregation only had to answer a few lines each time.

“Come back, Frankenstein!” they bellowed around him.

Dennis leaned to Roshni. “I—”

“Rage, children of transgression!” the preacher yelled, raising a fist.

The congregation roared like a herd of bulls. Dennis saw that even Melanie was getting into it. It was cute when she did.

The preacher’s sermon went on. It sounded like complaining, but when the congregation had to yell back, he tried to fit in, yelling, “Build us a family, Frankenstein!” before loud-whispering, “This is stupid, honey. We’re yelling at a painting.”

“Shhh, it’s date night.”

“As the creator took the power from god, so must we take the creator’s power!” the preacher said lifting a jar, sloshing with green liquid.

“Come back, Frankenstein!” the congregation said.

“The Frankenstein transgressed against nature for personal glory and then abandoned us!”

The congregation roared.

“Life comes in the marriage of tonics and voltage and flesh! The Frankenstein gave us superiority over every thing upon the Earth.”

“Make more of us, Frankenstein!” the congregation answered.

“Grace is in the revivification. Creating sewn people is an act of communion!”

The congregation roared.

“The Frankenstein looked upon the thing he created and wept!”

As if that was a cue, the roar within the church changed. The congregants wrenched and tore and hit the pews, the floor, the walls, bellowing, trying to rip up anything they could to smash. Dennis helped Melanie rip the pew out of the floor. They heaved together, barely missing a family punching the pulpit. Dennis and Melanie smiled in a sudden stillness encompassing only the two of them. Melanie tugged him by the hand.

“Let’s violate the confessional!”

Dennis looked around the confusion. No one was watching them. He followed her into the dark box.

The church was a shambles, as it probably was each week. Pews were smashed. Walls bore dents. Birds flew through broken windows. Everything was damaged except the painting of Frankenstein. A sewn man in coveralls with fine fingers swept the floor and barely looked up at the emerging couple. No one else was here.

“. . . wrecking the church felt good, but what’s the point?” he continued. “If there ever was a real Frankenstein, he’s dead and we don’t need him now.”

“We should go terrorize a human village,” Melanie said. “We haven’t done that in years!”

They held hands under the Frankenstein painting.

“Society says sewing animals is perverted, but I think people are just worried that if an animal can be sewn, what’s left about us that’s special?”

Her shoulders slumped a bit, but she smiled at him. “You don’t have to sew a puppy, honey. Francie will get over it. I just . . . I just got frustrated with asking, ‘Is this all there is?’”

He looked at her fingers, uneven, mismatched, different skin colors, all sewn to muscular hands. They were magnificently ugly, unnatural, and beautiful.

“Being sewn doesn’t give us grace,” he said. “Transgression does.”

“We take grace,” she said, smiling, “like everything else we’ve seized from nature and creators.” She kissed him again.

Dennis stood at the front door with Melanie. On her knees, Francie vibrated with excitement in the middle of the lawn. Roshni and a few neighbors looked over the fence, their scarred foreheads sweaty in the sun.

“Are you ready, pumpkin?”

“Yes, yes, yes!”

Dennis opened the door.

A big ghoulish dog bounded onto the lawn. Francie’s eyes widened in confusion at its deep chest and its wide mouth in its huge head, sewn onto a big neck, the skin still showing where he’d shaved the body parts.

It was a big dog’s body, capable of taking a full revivication charge without burning. The only problem had been that the vertebrae of different dogs hadn’t fit properly, so the massive head was actually sewn on upside down, the big wet tongue flapping from its snout, slapping one eye.

But it was puppy too. Four puppies. Every one of the puppies Francie had accidentally loved too hard. He’d sewn the upper bodies and heads of each of the puppies to the ankles where big dog feet would have been. As the dog bounded, the little heads yipped and barked and panted, squeaking in confusion, their faces smushed into the grass.

The dog barreled down on Francie but fell over its own head-feet, crashing to its back and going still, the big head apparently confused that it was right side up, with all four of the puppy half-bodies lifted high in the air, panting and barking.

Francie jumped on the dog’s chest, laying her head in the fur while head-legs tried to grab and lick her. Francie squeezed so hard that the big dog head wheezed, eyes bulging, tongue hanging like overcooked fettuccine. Then, she relented, and the big head began snuffling at the grass.

“It’s awful!” said one of the neighbors.

“Mommy! I’ve got five puppies!” Francie said.

“It’s a monster,” another said.

The dog rolled over, uncertain about stepping on the wriggling puppy heads again, confused by the tilt of its head attached upside down. It craned its neck and licked Dennis’s shoe. Francie giggled and tried to catch the slippery tongue.

“It’s a miracle,” Roshni said.

One of the feet barked. Another, the head of the youngest puppy they’d gotten Francie, started dozing off.

“It’s genius,” a neighbor said.

“It’s like the Frankenstein walks among us,” Roshni said rapturously.

“Get the pitchforks!” the first neighbor said.

Dennis and Melanie put their arms around one another, watching Francie jump up and down on her dog’s belly between four gleefully licking puppy heads. <|endoftext|>

And lo, the Princess said: “Motherfucker, I am content.”

“But Princess!” said the Knight, from the base of the Princess’ tower. His armor-clad ass was parked atop a huge black stallion, which the Princess found not only pompous, but entirely predictable. “You misunderstand; I’m here to save you from — ”

“Hold up,” said the Princess. “Exactly what part of girl-lives-in-her-own-goddamned-tower implies a need for rescue?”

“Well, I — ”

“Do you have any idea how many women would kill for a tower off in the wilderness? I am fucking blessed.”

“Princess,” said the Knight, “that’s all well and good, but this isn’t your place. You belong — ”

“Perpetually pregnant in a castle that smells like chlamydia? Pass.”

“M’lady, please. I only want what’s best for you.”

“Oh God,” said the Dragon, which in both size and shape resembled a hairless cat with wings. “Here we go again.”

“Do not. Fucking, M’lady me,” said the Princess. “And why is that a Knight I’ve never met gets to decide what’s best for me?”

“M’lady,” said the Knight, “you aren’t seeing the whole picture here: I’ve spent the last three weeks traversing this kingdom of yours for the sole purpose of freeing you from the diabolical clutches of the Fire Dragon.”

“Wow, I’m right here,” said the Dragon, who was kicking sand around his litterbox.

“Just shove off, would you?” said the Princess. “We’re busy here.”

“M’lady!” said the Knight. “How dare you dishonor me so after everything I’ve done for you! The King will have your head for this!”

“I never asked you to do anything,” said the Princess. “This is literally the first conversation we’ve ever had.”

“Just give him a Heart Quest and be done with it,” said the Dragon.

“Why do I have to give him a quest?” said the Princess. “Why does every cantankerous fuck who’s capable of a fifteen-minute trail ride seem to think they’re entitled to a Heart Quest?”

“In hindsight,” said the Dragon, “your father really ought to have built this tower a little farther out.”

“You get a Quest, you get a Quest!” The Princess threw both hands into the air and waved them about. “Everybody gets a Quest! When exactly did I become the fucking Oprah of Heart Quests?”

“Who’s Oprah?” said the Dragon.

“Future stuff, never mind.”

“You are spending entirely too much time with the Time Wizard,” said the Dragon.

“Puns aren’t funny” said the Princess. “You’re not funny.”

“Hello?” said the Knight. “Is anyone listening to me? I feel that I am being treated badly and I don’t understand why.”

“That’s hurtful,” said the Dragon. “And I wasn’t trying to be funny. You’d know if I was trying to be funny — I’m hilarious.”

“M’lady? M’lady!” called the Knight.

“Fine,” said the Princess. “Here’s your Heart Quest. You ready?”

The Knight removed his helmet and smiled up at her. “I’m relieved to see you’ve found your gratitude, Princess. And know that whatever trial you have in mind, no matter how grand, how impossibly difficult it might seem, no matter how many men have died trying to win your heart — ”

“I want you to make every dog in the Kingdom fucking hate you,” said the Princess.

“Consider it d — wait, what?” said the Knight.

“You are a monstrous little thing,” said the Dragon. “And I’m here for it.”

“Yeah, you heard me,” said the Princess. “Bite ‘em, kick ‘em — whatever you gotta do. Now off you go.”

“But . . .” said the Knight. “I . . .”

“Problem?” said the Princess.

The Knight shrugged. “I just . . . I thought my Heart Quest would be more heroic. I really love dogs. I have three of them.”

“Sounds like the perfect place to start,” said the Princess. “Happy travels.” She slammed the window shut. “How long do you think we have before my next would-be savior shows up?”

The Dragon shrugged. “An hour, two at the most.”

“I don’t really feel up to painting. How about a quick game of Settlers of Catan?”

“This game kinda sucks with two people,” said the Dragon.

“You’re just pissed that you’re losing again,” said the Princess.

“That’s not it at all,” said the Dragon, who was a terrible liar.

“Maybe you should consider an avenue of play that doesn’t exclusively rely upon establishing a sheep monopoly.”

“I’m a fucking Dragon, Princess; we love sheep — we can’t help it.”

“The whole point of creating a monopoly is to enable yourself to trade from a position of power. And if you’re in a position of power while in direct competition with exactly one other person, they’re never going to trade with you, because it’s always going to benefit you more. Just saying.”

“Leave me and my dreams alone.”

“M’lady?” said a voice outside. “M’lady?”

The Princess dropped her head into her hands. “Please tell me you’ve got a Quest in mind. I am so fucking tired of this.”

“Uhhh,” said the Dragon. “Drink the ocean? Swallow the stars?”

“Too figurative,” said the Princess. “He’ll just come back in the morning with a loose interpretation and a scroll full of shitty poems. It’s fine, I’ll figure something out.” She crossed the room and threw open the window. “Yeah, what you want?”

“I’ve completed your Heart Quest,” said the Knight, who — of course — was sitting atop a huge black stallion. “And I’ve come to slay the Dragon.”

“Oh,” said the Princess. “Ohhhhh. Could you do me a favor and remind me which Heart Quest it was that I sent you on?”

The Knight cleared his throat. “You bade me bare my asshole to the leaders of the Thirty-one Realms. And — ”

The Princess snorted. “Sorry, please continue.”

“And the High Warlock of Gul. And the Merpeople of the Shallows. And the Merpeople of the Deeps. And the Cannibal Kings of the Savagelands.”

“And was your asshole well received?” said the Princess.

“It was not,” said the Knight.

“Very well,” said the Princess. “I shall confer with the Dragon as to the terms of your duel.” She closed the window. “So, he actually did it. What do we do now? Nobody’s ever finished a Heart Quest.”

“I could just roast him right quick,” said the Dragon. “It’s not a problem.”

“I dunno,” said the Princess. “I feel a little guilty about the whole asshole thing; I never thought he’d actually do it. And I can’t believe nobody murdered him! I mean, fuck, asshole is considered a delicacy in the Savagelands.”

“Truly rotten luck,” said the Dragon.

“Alright, alright, I’ve got an idea.” The Princess threw the window open again. “I have conferred with the mighty Dragon, and he has accepted you as a worthy challenger.”

The Knight dismounted and unsheathed his sword.

“There’s only one problem,” said the Princess. “The Dragon refuses to leave my side until he’s been defeated in combat. To keep me from fleeing the tower during the duel and what not.”

“So I’ll ascend the tower and slay the Dragon where it stands,” said the Knight.

“Yeaaaaaaah,” said the Princess. “About that.”

“What is it now?” said the Knight.

“Well, this tower’s cursed as fuck-all. The only way in is to climb its walls using, uh . . .” She looked around, but found nothing of use, and eventually, her gaze settled on her reflection in the window. “My . . . hair.”

“No way he falls for that shit,” said the Dragon. “That is patently ridiculous. Even if you somehow managed to not get pulled out the window, your hair would rip right out of your scalp as soon as he started to climb.”

“Not a problem,” said the Knight. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.”

The Dragon groaned and rolled his eyes.

The Princess tossed her head as if to lower her hair out the windowsill, but the Time Wizard had recently given her a pretty sick pixie cut, so there wasn’t much to climb. “This is what we’re working with. I’m open to suggestions.”

“Princess,” said the Knight, “I’m a man of twenty-five winters; I’ve only got a few years left. I’ll be dead before your hair reaches your waist.”

The Princess shrugged. “That sounds like a you problem.”

“I’m just going to throw you a rope,” said the Knight.

“Very well, brave Knight,” said the Princess. “I just hope the Witch’s curse isn’t too severe.”

“Did she . . . specify what the curse would entail?” said the Knight.

“I can’t recall exactly,” said the Princess. “All I remember is the witch cackling every time she used the word decocked.”

The Knight sheathed his sword and mounted his stallion. “Very well. I shall return . . . eventually.”

“Right on,” said the Princess.

“Yo, Princess,” said a voice from far below.

“That’s a new one,” said the Dragon.

“Bleh,” said the Princess. She pulled her paint respirator down around her neck and took a step back from the wall. A mural of the New York skyline at dusk rose before her, its skyscrapers bright and stylized, lit up in blurry yellows and golds, as if at night. The panorama spanned the entirety of the tower’s interior, and only the Chrysler building stood unfinished.

“Just — ” started the Dragon.

“Yeah yeah, I know, path of least resistance,” said the Princess. She set her spray can on the sill and threw open the window. “Heart Quest incoming in three, two — is that a donkey?”

“Mini donkey, yeah,” said the Knight. “His name’s Steve.”

The Princess cocked her head. “He’s . . . cute.”

“Yeah, he’s a dick though,” said the Knight. “Anyway, Heart Quest? Then I’ll be out of your hair.”

“Oh, right,” said the Princess. “Of course. Why don’t you . . .” she rubbed her temples with both hands. “I want you to travel the, um.” She sighed. “Sorry, I’m blanking up here. It’s been a long day.”

“It’s cool,” said the Knight. “No rush.” He sat down in the grass, ruffled through a knapsack, produced a carrot, then alternated bites with his mount.

“D’aww,” said the Dragon, who was hovering above the Princess’ shoulder.

“You’re supposed to be guarding my heart,” said the Princess, “not cooing over strangers.”

“Right, sorry,” said the Dragon. “Slipped right out. Won’t happen again.”

“Sure it won’t. Fucking softy.”

“That’s a pretty badass Dragon,” said the Knight.

“Flattery will get you nowhere, Sir Knight,” said the Dragon, though his tail was wagging vigorously.

“Can you give us a moment?” said the Princess.

“Sure thing,” said the Knight.

The Princess closed the window. “Help me out here, Dragon — I’m feeling a little flustered with the sudden departure from the status quo. We need a Quest.”

“Maybe something to do with bees?” said the Dragon. “Sit on the bees? Eat all the bees?”

“That’s not very concrete,” said the Princess. “All the bees in the kingdom, or in the land? You know, I’ve never really thought about it, but does the land include the kingdom, or is it the other way around? My father has to have a Venn diagram around here somewhere.”

“Focus, Princess,” said the Dragon. “And what does it matter? The whole point is to get him gone, right?”

“Well, yeah,” said the Princess. “Obviously. I just don’t want to phone in his Quest is all, otherwise people might start getting suspicious.”

But in truth, the Princess desperately lonely — just not in the way her suitors assumed. She opened the window. “Here’s your Heart Quest, dear Knight: I want you to eat all the bees in both the kingdom and the land.”

The Knight rose, removed his straw cap, and bowed. He was handsome, with dark skin and a full set of teeth. “Eat the bees, got it. Thanks — have a good one.” He mounted the mini donkey and steered it back toward the pines that surrounded the tower, flailing his legs around as the creature tried — and failed — to bite him.

“What the hell do you mean, thanks?” said the Princess.

“Princess!” said the Dragon.

“I asked for a Heart Quest,” said the Knight. “And you gave me one, so, thanks? I don’t really understand what’s happening here, to be honest.”

“But that’s a terrible thing to ask someone to do!” said the Princess.

“Yeah,” said the Knight. “I mean I agree, but I’m not going to complete the Quest, so I don’t really care what it requires.”

“You aren’t?” said the Princess.

“Nah,” said the Knight. “Sorry, I should have been more upfront about that. The short of it is that my Ma’s kinda garbage, and she’s been trying to guilt me into getting her a grandkid before she dies, so I figured that going on a Heart Quest would — ”

“Buy you a couple months of peace,” said the Princess, nodding.

The Knight gave her a sad smile. “Exactly. I figured you’d understand, given . . .” he gestured at the tower. “This.”

The Princess bit her bottom lip. “Hey, do you maybe — ”

The Dragon fluttered in front of her. “What is it that you think you’re doing?”

“What?” said the Princess. “It’s a three-player game at minimum — you wanna be sheep god or nah?”

The Knight, still twisted in the saddle, stared up at her. “You were saying?”

“Would you like to come up for a bit?” said the Princess. “I could help you figure out the perfect Heart Quest, if you’d like. Something that would buy you as much time as you need.”

“Well,” said the Knight. “I don’t want to impose, but if you don’t mind . . .”

“Door’s in the back,” said the Princess.

“Fuck, I did not think this through,” said the Princess.

“Obviously,” said the Dragon. “You are covered in paint, and you are not pulling it off.”

“Where’s that goddamned Wizard? This place is a total disaster.”

“She’s gonna be royally pissed if you summon her just to — ”

The Princess grabbed a clock off the mantle and smashed it against the floor.

“That was an antique,” said the Wizard, who was suddenly in the room wearing high-waisted blue jeans, a scandalously tiny blouse, and a pair of pink, heart-shaped eyeglasses.

“Everything’s an antique to you,” said the Princess.

The Wizard cocked her head. “Well played.”

“Anyway,” said the Princess, “I wouldn’t have called if it weren’t an emergency. Would you mind . . .”

The Wizard lowered her eyeglasses onto the tip of her nose. “Seriously? Again?”

The Dragon flapped over to the Wizard and perched on her shoulder. “I told her not to summon you for something so trivial, but she never listens to me.”

“I do too!” said the Princess.

“And she said I’m not funny,” said the Dragon.

“The fuck, Dragon?” said the Princess.

“I know, sweetheart,” said the Wizard. She scratched the Dragon behind his right ear. “You are entirely unappreciated. But I brought you something to cheer you up.” She pulled a crinkly bag out of a back pocket and handed it to the Princess. “It’s called ca — dragon nip. Don’t give him too much at once; it’s pretty strong.”

There was a knock at the door. “Princess?” called the Knight. “Door’s locked.”

“Is that a boy?” said the Wizard. “Oh, oh oh oh — I get it.” She winked. “Emergency indeed.”

“It’s not like that,” said the Princess. “We just needed another player for —”

“Uh huh, sure,” said the Wizard. “Do you need me to wipe the mural too? And your hideous clothes?”

“Clothes yes, mural no,” said the Princess. “I’m not finished with it yet.”

“You should do Tokyo next,” said the Wizard. “I imagine that would keep you busy for a while. I’ll bring some phots next time.” She snapped her fingers, and the room lurched back in time four months, when it was most recently clean. As did the Princess’ paint-splattered, once-white dress.

“This really isn’t what it looks like,” said the Princess.

“Yeah yeah,” said the Wizard, “whatever, I’m not judging. And a fling might be exactly what you need. Get it out of your system, you know? Gotta be lonely up in here.”

“Why does everyone think that my system needs — ”

The Wizard vanished.

“So you brought the donkey,” said the Princess. “Inside.”

“I was worried he’d be cold,” said the Knight, who was alternating between staring open-mouthed at the graffiti skyline and squinting into the rulebook.

“D’aww — sorry, sorry,” said the Dragon. The three of them were sitting at the table — the Dragon looking only slightly ridiculous in his high chair — with the boardgame between them.

“Well, does Sir Steve need anything?” said the Princess.

“Nah,” said the Knight, “he’s no trouble. He’ll probably shit on the floor at some point, but he’ll clean it up if we give him enough time.”

“The mark of a noble beast,” said the Dragon.

“Yeah, sure. So what’s the deal with the painting?” said the Knight.

“They’re the towers of the future,” said the Princess. “People pay to live in them, get away from the street noise, look down on people and so on.”

“They’re beautiful,” said the Knight. “I’ve never seen anything like them.”

The Princess smiled — genuinely — for the first time in much too long. “Thank you.”

The Dragon cleared his throat.

“Okay,” said the Knight, “I think I’m ready to play. Who’s first?”

“Dragons go first,” said the Dragon.

“Of course they do,” said the Princess.

The Dragon grabbed a blue settlement piece in a paw and set it down on a hexagon. Then picked it back up. Then set it down on a different hexagon. Then picked it back up again.

“Any day now,” said the Princess.

“You’re making me anxious,” said the Dragon. “Just let me think for a minute.”

“What’s there to think about?” said the Princess. “We both know you’re going to pick the spot with the most sheep.”

“I feel like I might need to reread the manual,” said the Knight. “I don’t remember sheep being all that important.”

“They’re not,” said the Princess.

“Maybe not to you,” said the Dragon. “How am I supposed to choose between two spots that offer an identical amount of sheep?”

“Get comfortable, sir Knight,” said the Princess. “It’s gonna be a while.”

“Well,” said the Knight. “Since we’re on the topic, I’m not really a Knight.”

“Wow, I am shocked,” said the Princess. “Dragon, are you shocked?”

“So shocked,” said the Dragon. “Immeasurably shocked.”

“You both knew I was lying?” said the Knight.

“You ride a miniature donkey,” said the Princess. “C’mon man. Just cause we’re pretty doesn’t mean we’re stupid.”

“Aww,” said the Dragon. “You implied that I’m pretty.”

“And I already regret it,” said the Princess.

“That’s fair,” said the Knight. “But if you knew I wasn’t a Knight, then why’d you invite me up? Only Knights get Heart Quests. . .so. . .”

“Settlers sucks with two players,” said the Dragon.

“Oh,” said the Knight. His eyes dropped to the boardgame. “I see.”

“Dragon!” said the Princess.

“What?” said the Dragon. “You told the Time Wizard — did you just kick me under the table?”

The Knight gave the Princess a small smile. “It’s alright — I never expected to get a Quest at all, really.” He shrugged. “I guess I’m just trying to say that I appreciate your help, regardless of why you offered.”

“Okay,” said the Dragon, “I’m going to go with. . .no, never mind. Sorry sorry, one sec.”

“Was the rest of it true?” said the Princess. “About why you wanted the Quest?”

“Yeah,” said the Knight. “My family’s in the rat catching business, so I won’t be able to put kids off for long.” He clasped his fingers together atop the table, his many scars standing bright against his skin. “But a few months shouldn’t hurt. I figure Ma will let up for a bit if it seems like I’m courting someone.”

“Sorry, I don’t follow,” said the Princess. “Why is it that you need kids?”

“Tight spaces require small hands,” said the Knight, softly.

“That’s pretty gross,” said the Dragon.

“Dragon, manners,” said the Princess. “Somebody’s gotta catch the rats.”

“What about you?” said the Knight. “How’d you end up locked away in a tower?”

The Princess’ cheeks warmed. “Oh, this — it’s not like that. This tower. . .it was a birthday present. Sounds a little ridiculous compared to, well, your situation. Sorry.”

“Oh, it’s fine,” said the Knight. “If someone gave me a tower, I’d live in it too. But I’m guessing there’s more to it than that.”

“Yeah,” said the Princess. “I didn’t want to get married, but that’s just what you do when you’re the daughter of the King. It’s pretty much your whole purpose in life. So the tower was a compromise. I get to avoid all the courting bullshit, and when somebody in the kingdom — the land? — gets too ambitious, my father sends them here to seek my hand. And I get rid of them for a while with a Heart Quest.”

The Knight nodded. “An elegant solution.”

“You two done chatting?” said the Dragon. “It’s your move, Princess.”

“. . . How did we let this happen,” said the Princess. “I am so ashamed.”

“One thing just led to another, and. . .” said the Knight. “I feel physically ill.”

“Ugh,” said the Princess. “This is the worst day of my life.”

“I’m so glad my Ma isn’t here to see this,” said the Knight.

“You may call me. . .Sheep Master,” said the Dragon.

“How did we let him block all the trading ports?” said the Princess. “We’re totally cut off from everything.”

“I have no idea,” said the Knight. “It doesn’t seem like this should be possible.”

The Dragon clucked his tongue, and a little jet of flame licked out from his nostrils. “The game would be a lot closer if the two of you had spent less time flirting and more time strategizing.”

“We weren’t — ” said the Princess.

“We were just talking,” said the Knight.

“What the fuck happened here?” interrupted the Wizard, who was now in the room again.

The Knight tipped back in his chair and crashed to the floor. “Steve, save yourself!”

The donkey quirked its ears, then went back to sleep.

“Really?” said the Wizard. “That’s your first thought, dude? Wizard sails through the ocean of time only to magically poof into the center of the room and your gut instinct tells you that I’ve come for your undersized donkey? Do you believe the future to be donkey-less? It is not.”

“It just kinda popped out,” said the Knight, who was climbing back into his chair. “I’m not proud of it.”

“I think it’s sweet,” said the Dragon.

“Of course you do,” said the Princess, “cause you’re a fucking sucker.”

“Also,” said the Wizard, “why is there a donkey in here? Is that a pile of shit on the floor? And how is this game not over — am I seeing this correctly? Wow, you two suck at Settlers. You are like, preposterously terrible.”

“The game hasn’t ended because Dragon won’t end it,” said the Princess. “All he has to do to win is build another settlement but he’s just wasting time collecting sheep.”

“He is prolonging our suffering,” said the Knight. “Needlessly.”

“I play by my own rules,” said the Dragon.

“There is a literal rulebook on the table,” said the Princess.

“Can we get back to the Wizard thing?” said the Knight. “She’s a Wizard? There are Wizards? Do I get a wish?”

“Those are genies,” said the Wizard. “But you can ask me a question about the future, if you’d like.” She turned to the Princess. “Just wanted to drop off those drinks you asked for.” She set a wrapped package on the table.

“I didn’t ask for any — ” said the Princess.

“So, Mr. Knight,” said the Wizard. “You got a question for me? Better make it count.”

“This is a lot of pressure,” said the Knight.

“My my, how the tables have turned,” said the Dragon.

“Ten nine eight seven six five four — ” said the Wizard.

“When does the world end?” said the Knight.

“Ohh,” said the Princess. “Quality question.”

“Isn’t that a little fatalist?” said the Dragon.

“All the cool kids are fatalist in the future,” said the Wizard. “Fatalism is totally in. And the world ends in 2018, far as I can tell.”

“Far as you can tell?” said the Knight.

“Yeah,” said the Wizard. “It’s pretty strange: no matter how much time I spend in that era, the year never quite manages to end — something’s seriously messed up in the continuum. Anyway.” She patted the package. “You kids have fun. Night!” She vanished.

The Princess opened the package. “Wow. It truly never stops.”

“Is that from the future?” said the Knight.

“Yeah,” said the Princess. “It’s a box of wine.”

“A box of wine?” said the Knight. “The future must be a truly confounding place.”

“It’s like, a wineskin, but inside a box that holds it,” said the Princess.

“So what’s the point of the box?” said the Knight.

“No idea,” said the Princess. “Your guess is as good as mine.”

“So,” said the Knight, “the Wizard’s trying to get us drunk. Am I wrong to assume she intends — ”

“Nope, you’ve got it,” said the Princess. “Her too.”

“Oof,” said the Knight. “That’s unfortunate. Well, maybe. . .”

“Yeah?” said the Princess.

“Never mind,” said the Knight. “Not the best idea. Does the Wizard ever bring you anything more substantial? Medicine, gadgetry, weapons?”

“Spray paint aside, it’s pretty much just board games and refreshments,” said the Princess. “I imagine there are rules for what she’s allowed to bring back, but who knows — maybe she’s just holding out on us.” The Princess looked over her shoulder. The sun was setting, and her heart dropped just a little. She didn’t want the Knight to leave, so she twisted the nozzle out of the box. “What do you think?”

“Well,” said the Knight. “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious. Particularly about the role of the box.”

“Are the stars spinning?” said the Princess. She and the Knight were lying side by side on the floor, their shoulders just barely touching as they gazed up through one of the tower’s skylights. “I think they’re spinning. Or is it just me?”

The Knight squinted. “Definitely spinning. Clockwise. No, counterclockwise. No, both. I feel exceptionally nauseous.”

“Boxed wine will do that to you,” said the Princess.

“Villainous box,” said the Knight. “Hey, look: the little stars inside your towers are spinning, too.”

“Ohhh, pretty,” said the Princess, “but I think it’s the room that’s spinning.”

“How’d you come up with them, anyway?”

“What do you mean?”

“The towers.”

“Oh, I didn’t make them up; those are actual towers that people live in, like, seven-hundred years from now.”

“Ohhh,” said the Knight. “I keep forgetting about the Time Wizard thing. It’s a little hard to wrap your head around.”

“Right. She brings me pictures — pictures are like, super realistic drawings, basically — and I spray paint the towers from those.”

“Why though? I mean, if you already have the. . .pictures.”

The Princess shrugged. “It makes me feel better, I guess. Knowing that there are people out there that want what I want, even if it’ll take a while for society to catch up. The paintings are a reminder that not everyone who lives in a tower is batshit-crazy for refusing to come down just to complete some stranger’s life.”

The Knight nodded sagely. “Shit’s deep.”

“I also just like painting, so. Hey, can you see the Dragon from where you’re lying?”

“He’s still passed out on top of Steve. Look at him — his eyes are open. He’s full-blown catatonic.”

The Princess snorted. “That’s funny.”

“Why is that funny?” said the Knight.

The Princess laughed, harder now. “I have no idea.” She snorted again. “But I think it’s funny.”

“I can’t believe you gave the Dragon the whole bag of nip.”

“We were never getting out of that game otherwise,” said the Princess.

“Wasn’t the worst thing,” said the Knight.

“We could’ve died,” said the Princess.

“That seems a tad dramatic,” said the Knight.

“I saved your life,” said the Princess.

“I will be forever grateful,” said the Knight. “Is there any boxwine left?”

The Princess sighed. “Nope. Nary a drop of box to be found.”

“Ha,” said the Knight. “Nary. See, nary’s a funny word.”

“Is it?” said the Princess.

“Yeah,” said the Knight. “You know how a word starts sounding weird if you say it too many times? Nary’s like that, but you only gotta say it once.”

“Nary. Narrrrry.” The Princess laughed again, high and clear.

The Knight looked to the window, where dawn was just starting to break, and the smile slipped from his face. “It’s almost morning. I should probably get going.”

The Princess rolled onto her side to face him, and he did the same. “You could crash on the couch, if you want.”

“I appreciate it,” said the Knight, “but I’ve gotta get back to work. Rats aren’t going to catch themselves.”

The Princess nodded. “Shame, that.”

The Knight rose and crossed the room, then carefully lifted the Dragon off the donkey’s back. “I believe this belongs to you.” He handed the Dragon over.

“Thanks,” said the Princess, as she cradled the Dragon to her chest.

“C’mon Steve,” said the Knight, and the donkey yawned and clambered to its feet. “Good boy. Afraid we’ve got a bit of walking to do.”

“I really enjoyed this,” said the Princess. “Tonight, I mean.”

“Me too,” said the Knight. “Thanks for having us.”

“Anytime,” said the Princess.

“We should. . .well, goodnight,” said the Knight. He opened the door and Steve trotted through it.

“Goodnight,” said the Princess.

The Knight stepped down into the stairwell and shut the door behind him.

The Princess grabbed the doorknob, swallowed the lump in her throat, then let her hand fall her to side.

A few minutes later, the Dragon finally stirred. “What Quest did you give him?”

“Motherfucker,” said the Princess.

“Yo, Sir Rat Catcher,” said the Princess, who was sitting on the windowsill, one leg dangling over the side.

The Knight, who’d just exited the tower, looked up and smiled.

“I never gave you a Heart Quest.”

The Knight laughed. “I completely spaced on that.”

“Me too!” said the Princess. “We must have been having too much fun.”

“Way too much fun,” said the Knight. He hesitated, and his gaze dropped to the back of Steve’s head. “But hey, look.”

“Yeah?” said the Princess.

“I don’t want to assume anything here, but I gotta say something really quick, okay?”

The Princess frowned. “Alright. I’m listening.”

“I don’t want to make this weird, but Princess . . . I think you’re awesome. And I’d love to see you again.”

The Princess teared up at that. She already knew where this was going — it always, always went this way — but it still hurt her heart all the same. She’d dared to think this Knight was different. Stupid, so very stupid.

The Knight cleared his throat. “But I just got out of a really serious relationship and I’m under a ton of pressure to settle down, and — oh no, Princess, please don’t cry, it’s not you, you’re wonderful, it’s — ”

“No!” blurted the Princess. She wiped her eyes with the backs of her hands. Her sorrows had vanished at the Knight’s unexpected words, and a hysterical joy was building in her chest. “No, it’s perfect. This is so perfect.”

“What is?” said the Knight.

“That you’re emotionally unavailable,” said the Princess, who was grinning so hard her cheeks were cramping.

“That’s a very strange thing to say to someone. I can’t tell if I’m insulted. Should I feel insulted?”

“No, I mean: Sir Knight, what I’m trying to say is that I’m emotionally unavailable, too. And there are so many cities I haven’t painted and I’m big on alone time and — ”

The Knight beamed up at her. “Seriously? You’re good with this?”

“I am so fucking good with this,” said the Princess. “You have no idea how good with this I am.”

“So,” said the Knight. “Friends, then?”

“A thousand times yes,” said the Princess. “I feel like my fucking heart’s about to explode.”

“Well, then that just leaves the Quest,” said the Knight.

The Princess licked her lips. She felt like she could float right up out of the tower. “Sir Knight, from this point forward and into the indefinite future, I require you to attend me every Friday at sunset for a night of boardgames and boxwine.”

“And maybe Tuesdays too?” said the Knight. “If you aren’t too busy?”

“Fuck yeah,” said the Princess. <|endoftext|>

By Aidan Doyle
The dogs’ barking let me know I had visitors. I reluctantly left my chair by the fire, pulled on my boots, and took my thundergun from its place on the wall. I rarely had any visitors apart from Magnus, which was how the dogs and I liked it.

When I opened the cabin door, the sun’s brightness made me squint. The sky was bluer than a husky’s eyes. Most folks enjoyed summer’s months of continual sunlight, but I preferred the peace of winter’s darkness. Nobody but a lover expects things of you when it’s dark.

I walked across the crisp snow, my breath appearing as a mist in front of me. A ten-dog team pulling a sled with two people in it drew to a halt outside my cabin. The two figures stepped off the sled, one of them crouching down to check the dogs and the other striding towards me. I recognized Kristin’s loping gait before I could make out her face. She always looked as though she was in a hurry to reach tomorrow. It had been years since I’d seen my sisters.

Kristin wore a heavy coat with wanted posters stitched onto it. All of the villains had their faces crossed out. A pair of silver thunderguns rested in holsters by her side.

“It’s a fine day for sledding,” Kristin said. Her tone suggested that only the most inglorious of cowards would disagree.

“Fine day for staying warm,” I replied.

Kristin glanced up at the sun. “Three months of sunlight. Ain’t no place for secrets to hide.”

Inga had tied the dogs to the sledding post. She was ten years younger than me and two years older than Kristin. The two of them had always been inseparable. “We need to talk,” she said.

My own dogs were still barking, so I said a few words to let them know that while the visitors weren’t exactly welcome, they were at least family.

My sisters stamped their boots and brushed the snow from their clothes before stepping into my cabin. I saw them register the fire burning during summer, a luxury I couldn’t really afford, but neither of them said anything. We all owe ourselves the occasional treat.

“Drink?” I asked, and they nodded. I reached for the good bottle. Family is family after all. I poured them each a glass of Dr. Iceheart’s Whiskey.

“How ya doin’, Elin?” Kristin asked.

I shrugged. “Getting by.”

“Ain’t nothing more dangerous than an ability to get by,” Kristin replied. “If you’re not careful that’s all you’ll ever do.” She took a sip of whiskey in preparation for what I expected would be a summer-long speech, but Inga raised a hand and Kristin fell silent.

“Mama’s gone,” Inga said.

It felt like I’d stepped onto thin ice. I was still standing, but I could hear the cracks beneath me.

“She went into Cold Man’s Dream two months ago. She didn’t come out,” Inga continued.

I poured myself another glass and sat down. It shouldn’t have been a surprise. We’d all known Mama’s recklessness would catch up with her one day. That didn’t make it any easier.

“We aim to give her the proper rites,” Inga said.

“How can you be sure she’s dead?”

Inga held out a ring of polished dreamstone. “Mama gave this to me before she left. It turned dark two months ago.”

“We need you to come with us,” Kristin said.

“You don’t need me.” With the news of Mama’s death, leaving my chair seemed like an impossible journey, let alone the epic travail across snow and ice to the land’s deepest dreamstone mine.

“We need a witness to choose which one of us deserves her guns,” Kristin said.

I should have guessed. It was all about the guns. Two guns and two sisters who wanted to be a warden. Warden guns only worked as a pair.

“I don’t want the guns,” I announced.

Kristin shifted uncomfortably. “No, we want you to be the witness. You should choose whether Inga or I carry on Mama’s legacy.”

“I’m the oldest sister. What makes you think I don’t deserve Mama’s guns?” I didn’t want to become a warden, but that was no reason for my sisters to disrespect me.

“You suffer from a dangerous lack of ambition,” Kristin replied.

“Find another witness,” I told her.

“You’re family,” Kristin said. “We need you to choose.”

I shrugged. “Someone else can do that.”

“Family,” Inga said.

“Family,” Kristin said. “You were always there for us when we were growing up.” When Mama wasn’t, she didn’t need to add.

“We need you,” Inga said.

I sighed. “If Mama didn’t make it out of Cold Man’s Dream, what makes you think you will?”

“We’re taking the troll train,” Kristin said.

I’d always wanted to ride the troll train. Sitting in relative comfort seemed like the perfect way to explore the world. I looked at the photo of Mama on the wall. She was wearing the badge and guns of a Warden of Light and Dark. When I was ten, and she was pregnant with Inga, I worried Mama was going to abandon when she had another child. Mama promised she’d never leave me. Yet four years later she told us she’d brought peace to our settlement and needed to travel further to spread justice. She gave me a thundergun to protect myself, but her most precious gift was a belt buckle made in the shape of a dog’s face and containing a fragment of Light and Dark. Then she left us in the care of our father.

“Give me a day to make my preparations,” I said. “The dogs will need looking after.”

My cabin contained books, whiskey, and an open fireplace. It was world enough for me, but every time I was on a sled, I was reminded of how much I loved the feel of rushing across the snow, the wind caressing my face, the expressions of absolute joy on the dogs as they raced.

My neighbor had promised to look after my dogs while I was away, but I didn’t like spending time away from them. My sisters’ dogs took us to the town closest to the troll station entrance and then they sold the dogs. It’s hard to trust people who would sell a dog.

Before she left, Mama told me to take good care of my sisters and the dogs. “Dogs are fiercely loyal, Elin. Some folks take advantage of that and treat them badly. Sometimes I forget and take them for granted, but they always have a special place in my heart.”

The ten feet high station entrance was carved into the side of a glacier overlooking the town. A troll with gray stone skin waited inside, standing out of the sunlight. “State your business,” he said in a rumbling voice.

I’d seen trolls before, but never up this close. A thundergun would have little effect on a troll, and it would have taken little effort for the troll’s mighty fists to turn us into a thin paste. I didn’t know what a fragment of Light and Dark would do, but I couldn’t help reaching down to place a reassuring hand on my belt buckle.

“We’re the daughters of Sara Birtasdottir,” Inga said.

“Follow me,” the troll replied. He turned and marched into the tunnel.

I couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief. “How does he know Mama?”

“Mama foiled a train robbery,” Kristin answered. “Her family are allowed to ride the trains.”

There was so much I didn’t know about Mama. She was the least nostalgic person I’d ever met. From her point of view, the past was gone and unchangeable. What was the point of blathering on about it?

The troll led us along a winding tunnel until we reached an ice cave littered with gleaming machinery. A red rock troll covered in scratches stood behind a workbench.

“This is Grindel Sharpstone,” Inga said. “This is my sister Elin.”

The troll dumped his tools on the bench and raised a hand in greeting. He stood well over eight feet tall and had ruby red eyes. “Are you sure you want to go through with this? I haven’t finished testing the necklaces.”

“We need a new warden,” Kristin said. “We need the guns.”

“There are ways to serve Light and Dark without wielding guns,” Grindel said.

“The train will be here soon,” Inga said.

“Give me a moment,” Grindel replied. He packed away his tools and we followed him through a tunnel to a platform carved from impossibly blue ice and illuminated by a line of phosphorescent mushrooms. Beyond the platform, lay a fifteen-foot high tunnel with parallel steel tracks laid on the ground.

Two trolls carrying sacks over their shoulders waited on the platform, but they ignored us. While we waited for the train to arrive, Grindel and my sisters conducted a negotiation that resulted in Inga handing over a bag of suncatching stones and Grindel giving us each a necklace made of pieces of polished dreamstone.

“This will reduce the effect of being exposed to large amounts of raw dreamstone,” Grindel pronounced.

“Reduce or stop?” I asked.

“Reduce.”

Kristin shrugged. “That’s as good as we’re going to get.”

The deeper the mine, the more dangerous the dreamstone. Prospectors risked their lives in the hope of making a big claim, but Mama had never been a prospector. Why had she gone into Cold Man’s Dream?

About an hour later, the ground shook and a sound like a million shards of ice calving off a glacier echoed down the tunnel. A beam of light lit up the walls and the train arrived in a rush of air. It consisted of an engine and six carriages made from red steel with dreamstone wheels. Light poured from a giant mushroom attached to the front of the engine car, and dark puffs of burned dreams spilled from the engine’s chimney.

“This is our temple to Light and Dark,” Grindel said.

“Only way to travel,” Kristin said.

Grindel opened the closest carriage door and we stepped inside. The carriage contained rows of uncomfortable-looking bench seats. All of the other passengers were trolls and pretended to ignore us.

A horn sounded and the train pulled away from the station. I knew the train could travel ten times faster than a sled of dogs, but it felt like we were barely moving. I had expected the walls to shake, but the floor was still enough to balance a glass of whiskey.

“Why are you coming with us?” I asked Grindel.

“The sun won’t set for another three months. I can’t go outside, but I take every opportunity to ride the train. If I wasn’t bound by the Light, there is nowhere I wouldn’t go. I’ll ride the train to the Coldwood station and back again.”

Inga leaned back against the wall and promptly fell asleep.

“I’ll show you the engine,” Grindel said.

“Is it safe to leave Inga?”

“A troll train is the safest place you can be,” Grindel said. He spoke to the conductor and we were allowed into the engine car. Waves of heat rolled off the furnace, where a granite-colored troll tossed lumps of dreamstone into the flames. Some folks believe that dreamstone is made from the dreams of the first trolls.

As if sensing my thoughts, Grindel fixed his gaze on me. “Dreams are only useful if they take you places.”

“But what if you’ve already reached your destination? You have to stop at some point.”

“Maybe you should have been born a troll,” Grindel said.

“Don’t seem like such a bad life to me.”

“There is both Light and Dark in everything,” he replied. He wished me luck in the mines and went to talk to the driver.

Kristin and I walked back to Inga’s carriage. She was still asleep.

“Where are we getting off?” I asked.

“The station near Coldwood. The settlement is a day’s journey from the mine.” Kristin leaned in close. “When we were growing up, folks used to say I talked enough for the three of us. You and Inga like to keep your thoughts buried deep. Everyone knows Inga would make a good warden. She’s got a sharp heart and a sharp mind and spreads justice like a white bird shits. Some folks think that words count for little compared to action, but the truth is that sometimes you need someone who knows how to talk and not shoot. If you choose me to inherit the guns, I’ll speak justice in the streets like nobody ever heard before.”

“I’ll think about it,” I replied, which was the last thing I wanted to do.

She squeezed my shoulder. “That’s all I’m asking, sis.”

Coldwood was the kind of place that reminded me why I preferred not to leave my cabin. A lawless dive with a saloon, kennels, and a prospectors’ equipment store.

“Coldwood is dangerous, so be careful,” Kristin told me.

The saloon’s battered sign read: Cold & Thirsty. It was not the kind of establishment where people made the effort of brushing the snow from their boots. A table of gamblers spared us a momentary glance before returning to their cards. The fog of whiskey fumes hanging over the table was so thick I could smell it across the room. A man in sealskin boots stood by the fire, a glass of green liquid clutched in his hands. His gaze strayed to the silver thunderguns at my sisters’ sides, before he turned his attention back to the fire.

The bartender was a bear of a man in a stained sweater. “Welcome to C&Ts. I’m C. And that is T.” He pointed to a troll dozing in the corner of the room. “Don’t get on T’s bad side.” He poured us some whiskeys. “Where you folks heading?”

“Cold Man’s Dream,” Kristin answered.

The bartender gave a low whistle. “Chasing the big dream. Good for you. Have to warn you that it’s mighty risky. The upper levels were cleaned out long ago. Folks who go looking in the lower levels don’t tend to come back.”

“We’re looking for a warden,” Kristin said. “Older woman with gray hair. Went by the name of Sara Birtasdottir.”

The bartender nodded. “Sure, I remember her.” He looked at each of us in turn. “I can see the resemblance. She was here a couple of months back. The kind of person who could fill a room without saying a word. Didn’t seem like your average prospector.”

The bartender didn’t have anything else useful to tell us about Mama, but he gave us directions to the mine. Inga finished her drink and went to the kennels to buy some dogs. I offered to go too, as I know my dogs, but Kristin wanted to talk to me.

Kristin ordered another drink and we sat at a table in the corner. “You’re wasting your talents sitting in that cabin,” she told me. “I know you ain’t no sharpshooter, but you’ve got a glacier-cold head in a crisis, Elin. A good judge makes a warden’s job much easier. You should have taken that job they offered you in Icebreak.”

I was surprised she’d heard about that. Icebreak had its charms, but I didn’t want to be a judge.

“Folks respect the decisions you make, Elin. The world deserves to see more of you.”

I stood up from the table. “I gotta take a piss,” I announced. “Where’s your outhouse?” I asked the bartender.

He pointed to a door on the other side of the room. “Out the back. Follow the trail”

I sighed. Trail? How did they survive in winter? But I preferred visiting a frozen shitter to listening to my youngest sister tell me what to do with my life.

I stomped outside and made my way to the fouler-than-I-could-have-dreamed outhouse.

After a moment of quiet repose, I did my business and headed back to the saloon.

The man in the sealskin boots was waiting on the trail, a gun pointed at my head. “I can always spot the weakest members of the herd,” he pronounced. “I’ll give you a piece of free advice. If you don’t want to look helpless, you shouldn’t stare at the ground all the time. There are better places to look than at a man’s boots.”

In the case of the man in the sealskin boots that was evidently untrue. “I’m used to looking at the ground because I’m watching for hidden crevasses.”

“I bet you’ve never even fired that fancy polished gun hanging by your side.”

That was true but it wasn’t going to save his life. “Are you going to try to rob me or are you going to stand there all day bleating like a snow sheep?”

“You got quite the lip on you for someone with a gun pointed at their head.”

“My mama gave me this gun.”

He had a dry, hacking laugh. “That’s mighty sweet. Almost a shame to deprive you of that pretty ornament. But papa needs his drinking money.”

“If you leave now, I won’t hurt you.” Maybe I was telling the truth.

He scowled. “There’ll be a hole in your head before your hand gets halfway to your gun.”

He was only looking at my thundergun, but Mama’s belt buckle was a resting place for a fragment of Light and Dark. A shadow and beam. I willed the Light and Shadow to leave the buckle. A ball of shadow and fire rushed out and incinerated the man so that nothing remained except his sealskin boots.

Even without my help, Inga got us a fine set of dogs. It was a tough ride, but we reached Cold Man’s Dream in less than a day.

Folks are always seeing shapes in rocks. White Bird Rock. Ice Bear Boulder. Three Dog Peak. But most of the time they look like gray and ugly rocks. The side of this mountain did look uncannily like a man’s face. A gray and ugly man. The mine entrance was a tunnel cut into his eye and marked by tattered claim flags.

“What happens to the dogs if we don’t come out?”

“I told the kennel owner he could have the dogs if we weren’t back in four days,” Inga said. “The dogs were expensive enough that he’ll make the trip.”

The legends said the mine was so deep that the dreamstone in the lower levels had formed in the time before the trolls and held the dreams of Light and Dark themself. I reached up to reassure myself the troll’s necklace was still around my neck.

“Time to pay our respects to Mama,” Kristin announced.

I attached a set of walking spikes to my new sealskin boots and we entered the mine. My sisters hadn’t asked me where I’d got the boots, but they weren’t stupid. I hadn’t had any trouble sleeping the night after I killed that man. Sometimes it was hard to tell how much of my numbness was due to the cold. My belt buckle was gone, and I only had a thundergun to protect myself. I was a terrible shot.

The tunnel floor was coated in ice and without my spikes I would have slid everywhere. The roof looked like a great frozen wave of a million blue jewels about to crash down on us. We trekked through the tunnel until we reached a crevasse wide enough that even a troll would have hesitated to make the leap. An iron spike with a frayed rope attached to it was set into the side of the wall, but the rope came loose when Kristin pulled on it

Kristin took a rope from her backpack. Inga and I stood in silence while we waited for Kristin to lasso the spike.

“No speeches to win me over?”

Inga hesitated before answering. “You know me better than anyone in this cold land. Even Kristin. Sometimes it feels as though my mouth is full of fire, and I’ll burn the world if I say too much.” She reached out and squeezed my shoulder. “You know the choice to make.”

Mama used to say that knowing the right decision was one thing, having the strength to make it was something else.

Kristin secured the rope and swung across the crevasse to the other side. She pushed the rope and it swung back to us. I went across next and Inga followed me.

We kept going deeper until we reached the lower levels where veins of dreamstone lined the walls. Specks of turquoise light drifted out from the wall and floated around us until it felt like we were walking through the winter lights.

“They’re so beautiful,” Kristin whispered.

Inga pushed her ahead. “Ignore them. They’re cold dreams.”

The lights swirled around me, transforming into a translucent vision of Mama. The spectral figure looked just as I remembered Mama, even down to the details of her fleece jacket, shiny belt, and gleaming guns.

The image tipped its hat. “Howdy Elin.”

Kristin and Inga marched on ahead as though they hadn’t seen or heard anything.

“Howdy Mama,” I whispered. “Are you a dream?”

She smiled. “Always was, sweetie.”

“Why did you leave me, Mama?”

Inga turned to look back at me. “Don’t fall behind,” she warned.

I quickened my pace. Mama’s dream floated alongside me.

“I’m a dream, sweetie. I can’t tell you anything you don’t already know.”

“Who do you want to have your guns, Mama?”

“When I was a girl, I asked my mother what it meant to be a hero. She never could give me an answer I liked,” Mama said. I could remember her telling me that story. “The more I traveled, the more I became obsessed with the idea of a hero being someone who makes a decision so great that they don’t have to make any more real decisions. But that’s a foolish dream. There’s no final showdown to solve all your problems. There’s no white noon. You have to keep making decisions. Sometimes it’s easier to make one big decision than a hundred little ones. That’s the dream of being a hero. Life is harsh on the snow. Live or die. At home I didn’t have the strength to make all of the decisions that determined how I would live my life.”

We stepped into a great cavern full of dreamstone. Half a dozen frozen corpses lay on the ground, their eyes fixed on the dreamstone. Mama’s body rested with her back against the cave wall, next to a narrow tunnel opening. Her face was covered in flecks of ice and her guns were in their holsters.

I’d known this was coming, but it still felt like a blizzard had caught my heart in its grasp.

Mama’s dream form broke apart and the lights darted around the room. It had only been a dream, but it hurt to lose her again. Mama had to have come to this place for a reason. Had she been searching for the dreams of Light and Dark themself?

Kristin crouched by Mama’s side and said a prayer to Light and Dark. Then she used her lantern to melt the ice and plucked the guns from the holsters. She whistled in appreciation and handed them to Inga. “Ain’t these the finest guns you ever seen?”

Inga held up the guns, admiring their workmanship. One gun bore the image of the sun, the other was decorated with a black stone. Inga handed the guns back to Kristin and gently kissed Mama’s frozen cheek. “One of us will continue your work, Mama.”

Kristin turned to me. “It’s time to choose, big sister. Which of us is the most worthy to receive the guns?”

Either of my sisters would make an excellent warden, but why was it my decision? Was this the white noon from Mama’s dream? I’d always thought a hero was someone who made the right decisions. Not someone who avoided them. What if avoiding a decision was a decision itself? Or was this nothing but a way for cowards to justify their inaction?

“Time to choose, Elin,” Kristin said.

If I ruled against Kristin, she’d be angry and tell me I was a fool. It was harder to know what Inga would do. She didn’t wear her heart on her face.

“I think you should have a gun each.”

Kristin shook her head. “That won’t work, sis. Light and Dark. The guns won’t work unless they are a pair.”

“But what if you stay together?” I said. “Two wardens with two guns. Light and Dark.”

“You need to choose,” Inga said.

I crouched down in front of Mama and tried to work out what she had been doing here. Her dark eyes that had once seen everything looked at peace. She clutched thin pieces of dreamstone in her left fist. And that’s when I knew why she had come here. She’d been trying to use dreamstone to make her guns work by themselves. She’d wanted to give a gun each to Inga and Kristin. She hadn’t wanted to make a choice either.

I was the oldest, but Mama thought I was capable of looking after myself. Inga and Kristin were the ones she wanted to carry on her legacy. I was glad Mama had loved my sisters, but I would have traded my sisters’ happiness in a heartbeat to get Mama back.

Her right hand was curled around something. I pried open her fist, revealing a piece of dreamstone carved in the shape of a dog. It had the same expression on its face as the one on my belt buckle.

Mama might have taken me for granted, but I knew I had been in her thoughts at the end. I placed dreamstone coins on her eyes and wished her a swift journey to the next world. I stood up and stamped my feet. I wasn’t going to be caught in a dream. I wasn’t wasting my talents by living a quiet life. I helped others in my own small way and looked after my dogs.

I slipped the miniature dog into my pouch. Becoming a judge or a warden wouldn’t give me any special wisdom. Light and Dark bring the sun and the darkness, but it’s up to us to determine what is good and evil.

Inga and Kristin both stood still, their eyes closed. I slapped Inga with my glove, but she didn’t react. They were caught in their dreams. Kristin clutched Light in her hand and Inga held tight to Dark.

I shook my sisters, but they wouldn’t wake up. I could carry one of them out of the mine, but the other would be frozen to death before I returned. Which sister should I take?

Maybe there was a white noon. A decision you can’t escape no matter how hard you try.

Kristin was the youngest, but I’d always felt closer to Inga. No, I had to find a way to save both of them. I wasn’t giving up on my sisters.

The necklaces were supposed to protect us from getting ensnared in dreams, but they hadn’t protected Inga or Kristin. Why was I still awake? My dangerous lack of ambition? I was more focused on saying funeral rites than getting guns?

The guns! I prized Light from Kristin’s grasp. The gun felt perfectly balanced in my hand. I took Dark from Inga and held the guns in front of me.

My sisters’ lives were worth more than some stupid guns. I aimed the guns at each other and commanded them to fire.

Light and Dark exploded into each other. Sparks of light danced with shadows across the caves and the ground shook with their dance. The shock waves spilled against Kristin and Inga, and they opened their eyes. They stared at the ruined husks of the guns.

“What have you done?” Kristin asked.

“I saved your lives.”

Neither of my sisters were entirely happy with my explanation, but their complaints died when they saw the blast of Light and Dark had shaken loose chunks of dreamstone. We stuffed a couple of fist-sized stones into our backpacks and wished Mama a safe final journey.

The dogs took us back to Coldwood. My sisters started making preparations to sell the dogs, but I told them I was taking the dogs with me.

“They looked after us and we shouldn’t forget that.”

“The trolls won’t like you bringing dogs on the train,” Kristin said.

“Let me take care of the trolls,” I replied.

We said our goodbyes at the station. Inga and Kristin planned to go to the capital to petition the Place of Light and Dark that they both be awarded the rank of warden and given their own set of guns. I suspected that donating chunks of dreamstone might make their request seem more reasonable.

Kristin hugged me. “Take care of yourself, but make sure you do more than just get by.”

“Getting by has kept me out of trouble,” I told her.

Inga kissed me on the cheek. “Sometimes you need to burn the world.”

The troll guarding the station entrance complained about the dogs, but I silenced his complaints with a chunk of dreamstone in payment.

My sisters headed south and I took the train north. I bought a new sled and hitched my dogs to it and we raced to my cabin. The barking of my old dogs let me know I was home. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> When Hope Is Lost, Touch Remains
By Nin Harris
Chowrasta Market was where Maria had learned to love books — upstairs in the claustrophobic crush of second-hand book stalls, where the musty smell of old paperbacks was drowned in a panoply of aromas from the market downstairs: fish, the blood of poultry, and the musk-laden spore of murdered mammals. Her bookishness was all she was able to offer the men who occasionally fell in love with her. They drowned in her literary wit and her fragile insecurities until the time when, as with all relationships, one must drift away and make an end.

Sometimes the endings were congenial.

More often than not the congeniality masked a secret pain, a gnawing loss at the realisation that another hope had been proven false. Because what are endings but a betrayal of some hope? But then again, what are endings if they are not a culmination of choices made?

At some point you realise that all you have is this void. All you have is this emptiness, and that should be okay. All of the librarians, all of the words, all of the secret libraries that inhabit the books of the novelists you gorge yourself upon, could only exist in those worlds. They could never exist in yours.

Even when she drew men, Maria did not possess beauty of the usually celebrated kind. Hers was a quiet beauty with that keen edge of hunger, of roughness. Her skin rubbed against strange places and magnified each sensation to an unbearable friction. Her flesh grew strange upon her bones, transmitting sound and colour and light, becoming a silkscreen through which she could examine the world. When her eyes closed at night, her body abraded lightly against dewy sheets. At night, when all defences were down, her life evolved through the breathing of her epidermis and the attentiveness of her fine hairs.

On the public buses Maria occasionally took when she was sick of navigating the dangerously curved road that led from Tanjung Bungah to Georgetown by car, she sometimes had to work especially hard to keep her body sacrosanct. She did what she could to avoid touch so that the furtive rub of human bodies in the rush hour crush would not overstimulate her wayward senses. Occasionally she lapsed and allowed the movement of the bus to push her against a form, just so she could feel the purchase of skin against skin, allowing the impression of personality to permeate her soul. Gently, ever so briefly, before she moved away in faux respect.

One night, she discovered how to pull a man’s soul through his skin. It was an accidental, involuntary thing, birthed in a stray moment of hope.

Jakob was a civil engineer attached to the Penang state government, a widower. He commuted to the island every morning and every evening from his semi-detached home in Seberang Perai. Because these middle-class Malaysian households often ran like clockwork, Leonora, his bank officer sister would be waiting to give him updates about her day at work. There would also be detailed reports of how his three children and Leonora’s two daughters had fared at school. His dinner would be cooked by their widowed Kristang auntie. It would be wholesome fare consisting of Kristang and Hainanese food, with the weekly digression into pasta bakes and a Sunday roast. His sister was a divorcee who had moved in with him when his wife’s body gave up its fierce struggle against a cancer of the lung, leaving him bent with grief in the first-class ward at the Penang General Hospital. Auntie Philomena moved in to look after the household and the children. It was enough for Jakob, who thought he would never again remarry, for Angela had been the love of his life. Had been. Everything on the island reminded him of her, and so they had moved back to Seberang Perai on the mainland.

Even though Jakob had no library and was not a particularly literary sort, he was the quintessential E. M. Forster antihero in Maria’s eyes. That was enough. But Jakob was no foolhardy and resplendent George Emerson. No. Rather, Jakob reminded her of Leonard Bast in Howards End, who was trapped in a job and by circumstances, left only to dream about things bigger than the drudgery of his day-to-day existence. Like the Schlegels in Forster’s novel, his despair drew her. Here was someone whose soul was more broken than hers. The taste of that was sweet, as sweet as the innocence still contained within his eyes.

Maria found herself unwittingly ensnaring him over a series of coffee breaks as she worked on upgrading the software in his department in the state government. If only she’d known that Jakob would change the trajectory of her life! But Maria did not know, and so she wooed him with her eyes and her many little gestures, honed to an art form nearly two decades ago when she was young and sought-after by literary men.

One day, he did not drive across Penang Bridge to have the dinner carefully cooked by Auntie Philomena. Instead, he found himself driving Maria back to her overpriced condominium in Tanjung Bungah, with its tasteful furnishings and plump Persian cats who were extraordinarily well-behaved even by Persian cat standards. There, Maria offered him dinner in a half-hearted attempt at decorum. He hovered in the kitchen, watching as she carefully washed rice grains, and stirred the chicken debal she had in the slow cooker. If he had actually tasted Maria’s Kristang cooking, he would envision Auntie Philomena weeping tears of envy and outrage. Sadly, Jakob did not taste what would have been the best chicken debal of his life. Instead, he found himself giving way to touch and warm, animal desire. Maria found herself backed, not unwillingly, against the kitchen wall, her thighs automatically parting to accommodate the form of the man pressed up against her. She closed her eyes against the sweet feeling of friction: his warm body against hers, as his hot mouth claiming her lips.

Touch for them in this instance was not about romantic communion. It was a language shared between two people who had given up on life even as their skin hungered for more. They stumbled towards her bedroom in hot, hungry footsteps full of groping hands and the wet sound of human lips applying suction to various body parts in an orgy of awkwardness and need. When he finally shed his soul in her bed, Maria thought it was his skin. She was beyond surprised when it came off and into her waiting hands as she stroked his upper arms. He did not even notice the loss of it as he buried his face at her throat and sobbed like a five-year-old boy whose favourite football had been taken away. She hugged him thoughtfully as she carefully pocketed the glistening entity that squirmed in her grip. She kept it in the drawer beside her bed.

Later that night, after she gently suggested he spend the night because a monsoon thunderstorm raged outside, Maria stared at the translucent entity on her bedside table as Jakob paced the corridor outside her bedroom. It compressed itself into the miniature figure of a man who paced in the corridor, arguing with his elder sister who wanted to know if he was having an affair.

“I can’t be having an affair if I’m no longer a husband, can I?” roared Jakob, both in the corridor, and on the bedside table.

“Shush,” Maria said to the figure on the table, who looked up at her in surprise. “Into the drawer, go!” She opened the drawer of the bedside table, and the bashful diminutive figure slipped inside.

Seconds later, Jakob appeared and without a word and tried to enter her bedside table drawer.

“What are you doing?” Maria asked him, surprised.

“I . . . don’t know,” said Jakob, looking as bewildered as she felt.

Frightened but determined not to show it, Maria drew him down beside her and held him as she crooned him to sleep. When he slept, she opened the drawer. The miniature of him was asleep as well. Maria surveyed the miniature thoughtfully, then looked down at Jakob. He was a good man, Maria thought. One who did not deserve to lose more than he already had. She picked up his soul and carefully whispered to it, “Return to the body you came from.”

The soul expanded into the skin it was before and covered Jakob in a nimbus of golden light. Slowly, it was absorbed into Jakob’s body until there was only a naked, snoring man.

With a sigh of despondent bewilderment, Maria walked to the kitchen to get her ignored dinner, which she ate in front of the television. When she woke up the next morning on her living room sofa, Jakob had already left, without leaving a note. Maria was phlegmatic about it. She had bigger problems to worry about now, and besides, that night had been the last night of her contract with the state government.

Inexplicably, Jakob returned that evening. He wore a bashful expression on his face and brought a bouquet of chrysanthemums wrapped up in a Chinese newspaper. He roared at Leonora over the telephone again that night.

(Their dalliances would be peppered by the sound of him bellowing at Leonora, who was a resentful babysitter.)

This would have continued, had their encounters not been a reminder to Maria that she was not a normal human being. Fear caked her consciousness every time he left her, mingled with a growing affection that confounded her. Fear that she would forget to return his soul to his body one night. Fear that he would fall into harm’s way because of her.

One night, she whispered to his soul that he should never return. She looked at his curly hair and his deep brown back as he snored, and sighed. She would have liked nothing more than have a normal life with this man, but this was the man who had also shown her that she was not normal.

“In the morning, leave, and forget to return to this home. Forget me,” she whispered to Jakob’s shimmering simulacrum who slept on a book of poems. She blew it a kiss.

When he stopped calling, Maria accepted it with a phlegmatic sorrow.

The night that she discovered she had the kind of powers one only read about was the same night the Straits of Malacca began to talk to her.

It was a small thing, but it did mean that her evening walks along the waterfront became more interesting. She listened to the water. She remembered stories of her Kristang grandmother, who could prophesize the future. She remembered that fishermen in her family always had unusual luck with their piscine catches. The everyday magic of childhood family lore had come to be her waking reality.

When her soul felt as heavy as an anvil around her neck, she would walk down Batu Ferringhi beach while an equatorial sun stained its pale sands ochre and peach. She would listen to the complex melodies of the Straits of Malacca as figures of the puaka air danced upon the waves. These sea entities who were her sisters enacted entire histories encompassing conquests and naval warfares, of every boat and swimmer drowned. And as the waves spoke, she listened.

Every now and then, it seemed as though her grandmother was speaking to her.

They say her grandmother had died in her sleep, almost drowning in her bed. Her corpse had become so waterlogged that her coffin weighed four times what it should. It was a bit of a family scandal and that saddened Maria, who loved her grandmother so fiercely. But now, as her grandmother walked with her along the waves, Maria knew the truth. The sea had demanded her grandmother’s return, and one day it would claim Maria as well.

A woman who has had her first taste of immortality through sex magic would not be deterred from repeat performances, not even by her own scruples. Not through any fear of getting hurt — emotionally or physically. But sex was all she thought she wanted, that and the power she gained from it.

Her next lover was a shaggy haired bookseller from one of the newer hipster bookstore cafés that sprouted like kulat after a monsoon storm on one of the ghauts that led off Beach Street. She had stumbled into his café one hot Sunday after a fruitless trawl through the Occupy Beach Street market for anything that would lift the pall of an empty weekend. Lam was a goateed man in an artfully retro singlet. A straw hat perched upon his head. Tattoos adorned his upper arms and his chest. He pushed aside a stack of books to grind Arabica beans for her iced latte.

Maria craned her neck to read the spines of the books he had been arranging.

“Newly arrived from Kuala Lumpur!” he said with a toothy, friendly grin.

“Do you have the sequel to The Wall of Storms?” Maria asked as she pointed at the Ken Liu book atop the stack on the counter. But as with these things, the mention of the book served as a kind of a litmus test because she was attracted to him.

“Yes,” Lam had said, his eyes narrowed upon hers in sudden interest. “But I’m reading it first. You will have to wait.”

Maria’s face fell in what she hoped was an expression of utter disappointment. Maria was not used to guile but she hoped she had been artful. “Oh well, that’s too bad. I was going to order it online anyway.”

“Or, you could wait for me to finish reading it,” Lam replied.

So many of these entanglements revolve around choice.

Maria could have walked home, and Jakob would have been the only one who awakened her hidden powers. Maria could have, but she did not.

“Sure,” Maria said with a slow smile, “that would be great, thanks. But would I be buying it or borrowing it?”

“Have dinner with me and we’ll both figure that out,” Lam answered, his eyebrows quirked in an expressive manner that she found charming that afternoon, but which would begin to grate in later days.

Lam’s home was an eclectic library with books lining even his bathroom and the narrow corridor between rooms. That first night, when he led her into his apartment, she had gasped in surprise and arousal at the sweet smell of old books and the chemical used to preserve them. Their first coupling was a hurried thing of mutual violence and urgency upon a desk with books roughly pushed aside. They left marks upon each other as parting gifts.

(Sex with Lam possessed none of the tentative sweetness of her unions with Jakob, but it was not entirely bereft of tenderness, one would hope.)

That first encounter led to various other dinners and meetings in Lam’s apartment above his shop. Maria delighted in getting to know the younger literary sorts who thronged Lam’s apartment: the architect who lived above a provision shop on Gat Lebuh Pantai, the chef who opened a fine dining restaurant in an old Chinese home on Carnavon Road, the pottery maker who lived in Lorong Toh Aka. Almost, she could have loved Lam and not felt guilty about inveigling herself into his life. His soul was as rutilated as her own, full of perversity tempered by streaks of intellectual brilliance.

More importantly, she was able to achieve enough post-coital detachment and consideration that she never feared she would forget to put his soul, a small, amber-coloured pulsating entity, back into his body. But the sweet broken purity of Jakob’s sad eyes haunted her enough that she pushed Lam away, instigating a series of fights that led to their eventual mutual separation.

(She couldn’t have known it would not be the only time they would break up. Nor the fact that every time they made up, the headiness of reconciliation would grow stronger and stronger.)

Months turned into years. Finally she had a lover who seemed to mark the last of her hope that she could have a relationship with these men. They were meant to be prey, not lovers, she told herself.

Giovanni was a visiting scholar from Venice who told her he loved the melancholy, poetic light in her eyes. At sixty-five, he possessed a desperate kind of ardour that far surpassed her younger lovers, as though he tried to recapture his youth with each mingling of their sweat-dewed flesh. On the night before he went on a boating adventure to the waters encircling the islets off Pulau Langkawi, Giovanni had plied Maria with Chianti and home-made bigoli in salsa.

“Maria, when I come back from my trip, I will have something important to ask you,” declared Giovanni expansively that last night in bed.

“I can hardly wait,” Maria said in a muted voice, wondering if she wanted to spend the rest of her days with this courtly scholar, who lived a gentleman’s life in a modest little apartment in Venice.

He was particularly energetic that final night, expelling his soul with such gusto that the pearl-coloured simulacra flew across the bedroom to land on a bookshelf. Exhausted and mildly panicked, Maria forgot about returning that luminous, excitable thing that bounced up and down on her bedside table to Giovanni’s body as he snored. Instead, she had burrowed into his arm with an air of comfortable familiarity, thinking that perhaps wedding Giovanni would not be so bad a thing. It would be nice to be a married Signora in Venice, she fancied, dreaming of a life she thought she could never have.

(A life far away from this island of our hopes, dreams, and desires.)

She woke up to breakfast on her dining table, next to a vase filled with tiger lilies. Giovanni’s simulacra sat beside the glass-encased butter, looking like a glass coffin. Maria shivered at the thought of Giovanni out there, soulless. She had read enough to find in that innocuous butter case an ominous foregrounding. Giovanni’s simulacrum-shaped soul paced the dining table before it fell backwards, simulating swimming and then drowning. As she watched, something broke little Giovanni apart, making a messy splatter of ectoplasm on her dining table before the little figure slowly re-assembled and looked at her with a strange pleading expression on its quickly reconstructed face. She swallowed her cry of horror and let the simulacra nestle on her open palm.

When the phone call came, she was not surprised.

She grieved in the weeks after, even if their dalliance had not lasted too long. She was the person called to identify his mangled remains, the one who had to notify his next of kin. She blamed herself for his death, for that one moment of comfort that led to her forgetfulness. Perhaps he would have had better balance if his soul had not been distracted in a remote location. He would still be alive.

Giovanni’s simulacra was particularly demanding and strong after the death of its host body. It would enlarge to human size. It became a spectral representation of the deceased and behaved almost like the demonic hantu raya that existed in frightened accounts and in sensationalistic newspapers, sold at five-foot-way stalls.

“Shrink,” Maria had told the simulacra more than once as it tried to embrace her, barely controlling her own muted terror. Finally chastened, Giovanni’s soul resigned itself to being a bedside table ornament and learned to scurry into the drawer whenever she had company over.

Sometimes, the tiny simulacra tussled and had drawer wrestling matches with the souls of the countless faceless men she brought to her bed in an attempt at oblivion, at making time stop, at feeling — something safe, something that did not make her feel she would be defiling lives. Sometimes, Giovanni’s simulacra watched as bits of energy fell from the bodies of men into her waiting skin, making it dewy, luminescent. Keeping her young and desirable.

As she approached the grim age of fifty, her exhaustion grew unbearable. Her skin and flesh felt rejuvenated by each encounter, but her own soul felt weighed down. She saw herself stopping at some point — if the magic would let her.

On the night of her fiftieth birthday, Maria craved a certainty that she had been seeking for nearly a decade. She waded into the waves, aware of the luminescent jellyfish that almost dance in the dimming light beneath the waves. She felt like she was almost inviting death every time she entered the water, but she knew what she wanted was some sort of communication. Some manner of certainty that would not come. The waters were not clean here but that did not bother her. Nor did the poisonous jellyfish. They had never stung her.

Perhaps the unseen ones pitied her that evening, for she was allowed a visitation.

“What are you seeking, daughter of my daughter?” asked that beloved, much-sought-after voice.

The waves coalesced into the form of her grandmother.

“I am not sure, Grandmama. I have never been sure. What is this . . . is it a gift or a curse?”

“Neither,” said her grandmother. “It is an inheritance. One that came from our home in Malacca. A long time ago when our ancestors came here from Portugal. When one of them married a Malay woman with a puaka laut ancestor. That union made us who we are. A family of fishermen and sea-witches who knew where the catch would be good. Who knew the secrets of the hidden world and of human souls. The water is in our veins, my dear.”

“Do you know everything, Grandmama?” asked Maria.

Her grandmother laughed. “No, not everything — but I do know you’ve found some very interesting ways to use your inheritance. Very interesting. I wish I’d been as enterprising when I was your age. Hmm, there was this man in the Portuguese Village who was quite dashing. It could have been so very sweet and tasty. But then, I was married to your grandfather, and he was a very holy man. He was the only man I knew. The only one that mattered.”

“Yes, he was . . . how . . .” Maria found herself thigh-deep into the waves as she approached her grandmother.

“You mean to ask, if we’re descended from water demons, how do we make lives with those who spend theirs in orison and devotion? I don’t know. We are mostly human, and I was as god-fearing as he was. Except when I needed to be brutal, to save my loved ones. You can be brutal too, Maria. Would you choose to do so?”

“I still regret the death of Giovanni due to my carelessness,” Maria said.

“Yes, and that is why I am here, love. It was not your fault. It was his fate. A fate he avoided for too long. That soul wanted to be with you.”

“What must I do with it now?” asked Maria.

“Release it into the ocean. Let the soul find peace. And as for you — what would you choose to do with your inheritance, love? There are so many things you could do with it. You could protect your loved ones. Or—”

“Or—” Maria looked at the face of one so beloved, and one near-forgotten.

“Or, you could find that sweet-souled man you never forgot and see if you can’t find a life like I did, playing by ear — dancing between darkness and light. It was good enough for me, after a fashion. Could it be good enough for you, my granddaughter who could never stop looking?”

“I do not know, Grandmama. I do not know.”

“Don’t wait too long to make that decision, love. Lives are not meant to be lived in limbo, as yours has been for far too long.”

The tide washed her with a force unusually strong back to the littered beach.

The very next day, Maria killed her first man. Or she could have. Nobody ever knows how to predict these things.

Or, she could have, if she wanted to. She could have drawn out his entrails as he lay begging at her feet. She had stalked him after she tasted his murderous intentions, so thick it awakened all of her senses. She was emboldened by her conversation with her dead grandmother, and the things she could do with her inheritance crowded her mind. Drunk on possibility, she followed him from the famous pickled nutmeg and mango stalls at the newly refurbished Chowrasta Market into Tamil Street where the nasi kandar owner stood outside his unassuming restaurant, hoping to lure tourists into the depths of a shop that had seen much better days. Somewhere in the back lanes close to Kimberley Street where hawkers were setting up their stalls for the evening, Maria pulled the soul of the murderous man from the back of his neck and watched him kneel in the shadows as the soul danced in the palm of her hand. He was a worse monster than she could ever be, she told herself.

The soul was filthy. Rancid. Full of pride in how he had defiled many women. Full of hunger and the need to commit more atrocities. She could have crushed that soul in the palm of her hand, even as she shuddered at her first knowing act of murder.

(These endings and life trajectories are always about choice more than they are about hope. These endings could be the death of hope, or the birth of it.)

She could have done this: she could have made the soul walk the man all the way to the police station and confess to his crimes. She could have left the soul in her pocket, along with the soul of Giovanni. She could have released both into the sea. It would have still been a death, but a slightly more lawful, slightly more merciful death.

Her life hinged on that choice — one that would have taken her into a shadowed world of vigilantism, where all hope was lost to her — but not for the ones she could have saved.

Or,

She could have released Giovanni’s soul into the sea before driving her car across Penang Bridge, to a church where Jakob prayed with his sister and children every Sunday. She could have almost been happy with that simplicity, couldn’t she?

We are all poised on the cusp of possibility with every choice that we make. Between hope and despair, between desire and action.

And so walks Maria, with two souls in her pocket, and dark secrets in her eyes, a power so strong, so intoxicating. She could imagine herself liberating so many women from predators.

And so walks Maria into a life that swung from option to option like a pendulum, into the choices her grandmother knew she had to make so she could leap from limbo to life, from the loss of hope, to the renewal of her purpose. <|endoftext|>

Twenty-five years after the magic came back, Auden’s wife got turned to stone.

It was the dog’s fault. A cockatrice had been wandering Harlan County for the past few weeks, ever since some damn fool two towns over let a cock’s egg hatch instead of chucking it backwards over the roof. Auden and Ellaree had dealt with a ’trice before, though, and they knew all the new-time tricks. Usually when monsters were about, they’d lock up the goats and chickens, and then stay inside with the curtains pulled ’til the beast passed them by. But this time they couldn’t find the dog, and Ellaree went back out to look for it. Auden tried to stop her, observed she didn’t have a lick of sense, risking her life for some mutt. But she grinned, told him she loved that mutt, and he didn’t know a thing about love, then she went out anyway.

She always was hammer-headed, that woman. It was what he loved about her.

Auden didn’t go after her. He remembered the dragon-wards they’d taught him in the army, but that was twenty years ago. He wasn’t some wizard who could sweet-talk a ’trice. His brother Ty even told him as much when Auden turned up the next day with Ellaree under a sheet in the wagon, board-stiff and glassy eyed.

“Y’can’t blame yourself,” Ty said, awkward in the face of his brother’s grief. Auden nodded, but his ham and okra grew cold on the table as he stared out at the cloth-covered shape in the wagon. You learn to stick together when you’re the only Black kids in the county, so he and Ty were always close, but this was something he couldn’t talk about, even with family.

“Be obliged if you could look after the animals while I’m away. Might be a spell.”

“Gonna go see the shaman?” Ty ventured. Auden frowned and lifted one hand to pull at his beard, but his eyes never left the window.

“Reckon so.”

Five years after the magic came back, Auden Rune-Shot returned from the war.

He’d been so young before, just a stupid kid who lied about his age so they’d let him slay dragons. Pop named him James, for the apostle, and mama called him Auden, for the poet, so when they died in the rift that destroyed Nashville, Jimmy put his name on the line at the recruiter’s office in Lexington, James Auden Clay, with a flourish and went off to make their deaths mean something. But war changes skinny boys from Appalachia, and not just in their bodies. The new times wore away at names somehow, and in any case, the boys in the 8th Mounted Division all got nicknames.

You had to be a bit touched to want to be an echinemon rider, but they were still just kids fresh off the Xbox, and half of them were dead inside a year.

The kid from Appalachia found he was better prepared than most. His old man pulled him off the computer every other weekend to go hunting and fishing and camping, and while Jimmy was on his phone the whole time, he still learned a thing or two. Hunting dragons wasn’t so different from boars once you got past the scales and the teeth and the fire.

Most of the 8th wanted to dance with the wyrms, the way an echinemon did, swaying and striking like a giant mongoose. The boys figured they’d take up their swords and do the same, but Jimmy was an old-timey kind of guy and knew he’d be useless with a sword. The drones and the cruise missiles were long dead, true, but the older stuff still worked, and getting a rifle to fire wasn’t too hard as long as you learned to mind your manners with the spirits.

So Jimmy was patient. He would take the high ground, just like Pop taught him, then lie down, check the wind, and whisper some sweet-talking. Finally, he’d exhale and put a rune-carved bullet right through the monster’s eye.

They never saw him coming, thanks to his ’kinna’s sharp nose for dragon-flesh, and his sweet-talking was good enough that the gun never jammed. The 8th tangled with gray wyrms that could teleport through fog, and gecko-patterned swamp wyrms that swam in earth like a fish in water, and huge acid-spitting black wyrms with their six unblinking compound eyes, and Jimmy shot them all the same. He killed more dragons than anybody they knew, and before too long, sweet little Jimmy Clay from Kentucky had a new name.

He had worried nobody would understand him back in Harlan County, but he found the new times had worked their magic on Appalachia too. His brother, Ty, for one thing, wasn’t the plump little twelve-year-old he’d left behind with his grandparents but a gangly teenager going to dances and mooning over girls. Auden wanted to skip the Welcome Home Heroes shindig, but Ty insisted, and that’s where he first saw Ellaree Golden-Hair.

She’d been Ellaree Chatham when he left, a willowy kid, shy and quiet behind a tangled mass of blonde hair. She was only sixteen now, but the new times were working for her already. She’d grown up and filled out, and she could talk circles around the boys. When she combed out her tangles, her hair shone like the sun, and by the time they started calling her Golden-Hair, she was already on her way to being the prettiest girl in Lexington.

Ty noticed Auden staring at her and laughed. “That’s Ellaree of the Golden Hair. Ain’t she a fine piece o’ creation?”

Auden gave him a sidelong glare, but Ty rattled on with a younger brother’s shamelessness. “Ain’t no harm in lookin’. Every boy in the state’s in love with Ellaree. But,” and here he gave a mournful sigh. “She’s off limits. Already spoken for.” When Auden asked who, Ty said it was some city boy from Richmond, come over the mountains to make rifles for the war and richer than the gods.

Auden asked Ellaree for a dance, and she accepted. Plenty of boys asked her to dance that night, but none were quite so dashing or handsome as the dark man in the cavalry fatigues, because once you’d gone toe-to-toe with a charging ice wyrm and put a bullet through its neck-gills, a little thing like an engagement wasn’t going to stop you.

He’d met her fiancé that night too. Fulton Gunmaker was tall and pale and clean-shaven, where Auden was short and dark and bearded, and he carried himself like a guy who had never considered how to kill a dragon. Even so, the gunmaker was an impressive man, even before you figured in the fact that he was only twenty-three and already owned half of Richmond. And of course, it didn’t hurt that he was white. Here in this new-time world it would been nice to believe that didn’t matter, but later on more than a few people would whisper behind their hands when they saw Ella Golden-Hair being courted by a Black man.

Fulton and Auden shook hands with the decorum of two Southern gentlemen who are about to calmly remove their coats before shooting each other in the heart.

Twenty-five years after the magic came back, Auden went to see the shaman.

The old wizard lived on the island on the other side of Kentenia Bay, and sunlight glinted off the water in the old gorge as Auden hefted his wife’s stone body into the rowboat. He winced as he straightened, stretching his back, and heard his spine crack as he regarded the bay, trying to remember how many years it had been since the sea came to Harlan County. The valley had once been deep and wide and all lit up with the red-gold of autumn, but the men who could remember those days were few and far between, he knew. It made him feel tired. His Pawpaw had been over twice the age Auden was now before he kicked the bucket, but that was back in the old times. Maybe these days forty-one was when you started being an old man.

It was a short journey, but the island’s bank was steep and slick with leaves. The carmine-streaked wakerobins grasped at his legs with their fingery petals, murmuring toneless flower-songs, and his toes went numb. It took Auden twenty minutes to disembark with Ellaree on his back, and another hour to scale the carved-earth stair to the shaman’s cabin, but the upshot was that the shaman heard him coming and had the workbench cleared off.

The portly man in the camouflage bandana examined Ellaree over his mirrored sunglasses, grease-stained fingers probing at her marble face, while Auden stood by feeling antsy and trying not to show it.

“Now, y’gotta be honest with me here, you try any o’ them herbal rituals before you came to me?” the shaman asked, fixing Auden with his permanently dilated left eye. “Mandrake, peony, any o’ that?”

Auden shook his head. “No. Just snowdrop tea and some low wards.”

The shaman looked at him for a moment longer, trying to gauge his honesty, then nodded grimly as he went back to the body. “Good. Those are the scary ones. And they don’t work anyhow. Gotta leave curses to professionals. The mandrake’ll whisper to you, so you gotta be careful or you’ll go touched. And can’t go messin’ with peony, or we’ll have worse than ’trice runnin’ around these mountains. Saw a case ’bout twenty years back, old boy down Chattanooga way ate some peony. You believe that? It called up daemon, o’course. Tore out through his left eye, poor bastard.” Auden nodded, mesmerized by the wobble of the old wizard’s beard, while his mind raged. The shaman was babbling old war stories while his Ellaree lay there frozen on the table. Then he realized he’d missed something.

“What?”

“I said, y’ain’t gotta look so down. You just hafta kiss her. There’s magic in a soul mate kiss, heavy stuff. She’ll be good as new.”

Auden swallowed. Yesterday he had slept next to her all night, trying to warm her, feeling her night-cooled marble skin scratch at his arms. The True Love’s Kiss was the first thing he tried, on her forehead and cheeks and mouth, desperate to soothe away the terror in her eyes.

“I already tried,” he said, like ripping off a band-aid.

The shaman’s eyebrows went up. “. . . you are her husband, ain’t ya?”

“I am,” Auden said.

“Didn’t have nothin’ on your lips?”

Auden felt his mouth tighten. “No.”

“Y’sure you got full mouth contact?” the shaman asked. “Full coverage? The placement can be hard when their mouths are—”

“I’m sure,” Auden snapped.

There was a long moment, then Auden asked, “What does that mean?”

The shaman took a deep breath, then let it out. Then his mouth crooked sideways, apologetic. “It means y’ain’t her true love.”

Six years after the magic came back, Auden and Ellaree had their first kiss.

He started writing her letters in the months after they met. The courier came to Lexington once a week to deliver goods to the open-air markets lining I-75, and each time he dropped off another thick envelope. Ellaree found them filled with thrilling war stories, playful flirtation, and gentle wit, and soon she looked forward to them.

She wrote back, laughing and cajoling and fighting, asking question after question. He claimed he loved her, but she scoffed, saying that he might know how to kill dragons but clearly knew nothing about love.

She would reread them while stretched across the bed with her golden hair streaming out around her, face flushed and heart pounding as she read about how much he wanted her. She told herself she should throw the letters out, but it was sexy and it was dangerous, and each Friday when she rose before the sun, reading his words alone in the darkness felt like the most romantic thing in the world.

He came to see her at midwinter. She danced with other men, but she felt his gaze on her the whole time, and when she went upstairs to the powder room, he followed. When he kissed her, she twined her arms about his neck and kissed him back, pressing her body against him. Fulton was a nice man, but she was seventeen, and no one had ever kissed her this way, this completely, as if they were trying to disappear into her. She felt his hands on her body, and she gasped, her mind racing, feeling sure they were going to do all the things he wrote in his letters, and that’s when Fulton walked in.

The day the magic came back, Fulton Applebaum was an eighteen-year-old factory line worker from Carytown on a night shift at the foundry.

There was an odd folding of the air, a slip-sliding lurch like a penny on the tracks of the world, and that was that. The manager emerged from his office to complain that the internet was down and found his workers gaping out the front window at dryads emerging from trees in the parking lot medians. Fulton pressed against the window, craning his neck to get a better view of the twenty-foot tall jackal-headed man tromping through the parking lot with screaming ghostly figures chained to his belt.

People began pulling out their phones, waving them aloft and uttering strangled cries when they couldn’t find a signal. Fulton held down the power button of his old Nokia, whispering please, please, please, and as he wished, he felt wings flutter past his left shoulder, and his left eye gave the ghost of an ache. Then he heard a voice in his head saying, Well, since y’asked so nicely, sugar, and his mind flooded with words in some unknown language. He spoke them aloud, and instantly his phone flickered to life with a cheerful bleep. He had full bars and no one to call.

While his coworkers went home to check on their families, Fulton jogged down to the museum, broke the plate-glass door with his elbow, and headed for the military history wing. He hauled weapons out to the back lot by the armful, trying to ignore the black lightning forking past swirling purple rifts in the sky.

He tested them all, taking notes on his phone about functioning technology and word pronunciation. The invisible creature stayed with him, her laughing-bell voice lilting in his head, and within a few hours he had a budding grimoire on his cell phone.

Once he was satisfied, he headed back to the foundry, fired up the line, and worked through the night. Two days later, Fulton drove down East Broad Street with a pallet of flintlock rifles in his uncle’s old pickup. He wouldn’t accept paper money, but after two days in the new-time world people were more than willing to barter for a working gun, and when he was finished, his truck bed was stacked high with bottled water, canned food, toiletries, medicine, batteries, gasoline, tools, and first aid.

Three weeks later, when Fulton’s old boss came to check on the factory, he found two burly men armed with rune-carved muskets and dilated eyes guarding the front door. Fulton ushered the man into his office and cut him a deal that let him stay on as a junior partner.

Two years later, Fulton the gunmaker was the richest man in Virginia. But money and power wasn’t much good if you didn’t have anybody to spend it on, so when Fulton met Ellaree with the golden hair, he knew she was the love of his life.

The night he found her kissing another man, he didn’t shout or curse or make a scene. He simply asked if she loved him.

“I . . . don’t think I know anything about love,” she admitted.

Fulton’s brows knitted. Another man might have given his opinion on love, and she might have believed it, because he was her fiancé, and despite everything, she was still only seventeen.

But instead, Fulton took her hands, and when he spoke, his voice was even and earnest, if a little firm.

“I don’t want you to love me ’cuz I said so. I want you to know for yourself. I just know I love you. And if you can love me too, I’m gonna marry you.”

She looked into his eyes, and then she kissed him, completely, as if she were trying to disappear into him.

Twenty-five years after the magic came back, Auden loaded Ellaree’s body in the wagon and set off for Richmond.

He considered taking the pickup truck, but it didn’t run like it used to, and the older he got the less the spirits loved him. They were fickle. And besides, revving an internal combustion engine in an enchanted forest was a good way to get you eviscerated by some vengeful fae god.

When he’d been a young man, the mountain passes hadn’t been safe, but there had been less to worry about. The 8th Mounted Division zigzagged the Appalachians a hundred times chasing dragons around, and they feared neither gods nor monsters, but they were also badass gun-toting warlocks astride toothy weasels the size of cars. Auden was an old man now, maybe, and more than once he wondered if the world itself was bigger than it had been when he was twenty-one and riding to Richmond to stop a wedding.

A hag followed him for the first few days, her skinless body flitting between trees in his peripheral vision, but he slept with a mason jar by his mouth so she couldn’t steal his breath, and eventually she gave up. In the ruins of Abingdon, he encountered a shadowboy and spent a nerve-wracking evening hiding on a roof and muttering words he disbelieved to confuse the scent of his soul. At night he would lie awake staring into the darkness as the duende lobbed pebbles over his wards, chattering in faerie falsetto Spanish and laughing uproariously when they scored a hit. There were rumors the bird-goddess Camulatz, who ate the heads of the first people, was nesting in the Appalachians these days, but thankfully he didn’t see any sign of her. By the time he made it to Richmond, over two weeks had passed, not counting the time he made eye-contact with a chaneque and spent three days wandering in the jungle-out-of-time, his head filled with the murdered creature’s guttural Nahuatl wails.

He was worn thin when he pulled the wagon up to the gunmaker’s mansion and, with his stomach turning, trudged up the wide front steps to knock on the door.

Seven years after the magic came back, Auden told Ellaree she couldn’t get married, because he was in love with her.

He rode three hard days from Harlan and arrived that very morning. By the time he made it to the church, she was already decked out in her white dress, and if anyone still doubted she was the prettiest girl in Kentucky — and maybe Virginia too — they couldn’t doubt it any longer. She was radiant on her wedding day. She even looked beautiful when she was angry, mouth agape as she watched Auden clamber through the dressing-room window.

“You don’t know anything about love, Auden.”

He was undeterred, though his blue jeans were still askew from scaling the drainpipe. “I’ve always loved you. I ain’t stopped thinking about you in two years. I rode here to win you back!”

“And that’s what you think love is? Climbing mountains?” She threw up her hands. “I’m not a woman to you. I’m a dragon you wanna slay.”

Auden was angry now too. She could see he hadn’t expected this to be so hard. He was still the soldier, the ’kinna rider, bursting in to save the day. He hadn’t considered that she might not need saving. “Well whatta you think love is?” he said.

She was ready for this, though. She’d been thinking about it for months, like practicing in the bathroom mirror. Her chin tipped up. “It’s stability! Contentment! It’s deciding what you want your life to be and finding it!”

But he was closer now, and she faltered. The war had worked countless wards for quietus and stillness into his body, and nowadays it was somehow hard to see him moving. Abruptly he was right before her, magnetic with his nearness. “You don’t want me to be your life?”

That gave her pause because she hadn’t thought of it in those terms. Maybe you couldn’t think of everything when you were just eighteen, but she realized she didn’t want him to go away. He was still Auden, her Auden, sexy and brave and wild, and abruptly she couldn’t remember what she’d spent the last year telling herself. He saw her pause, and he was closer, so close she could feel his heat. He whispered, “You are everything I want my life to be,” and that was that.

Twenty-five years after the magic came back, Auden knocked on the door of the gunmaker’s mansion.

He expected a squire or handmaiden, but no one came. He thought about turning back, but there was nowhere else to look, and his Ella was in the wagon, screaming in stone, so he knocked again.

Still no one came, so he tried the knob and found it unlocked. The lights were off in the foyer, but Auden hadn’t passed over the Appalachians to run from the dark. He went inside.

He could hear voices, but nobody answered when he called, so he loosened his sabre in its scabbard and did some sweet-talking, feeling his free hand drag with the weight of magic. But when he stalked across the entry hall on moccasin feet and made it to the den, he saw no dragon to slay, only the gunmaker lying back in a voluminous La-Z-Boy in front of the TV. The massive screen was tilted askew, its cord snaking across the floor to a raw wire tangled in the carpet. Spirit-lights flickered behind the screen, and their odd inhuman phonemes drifted through the room like a left-hand language of men.

“I know you’re there,” the gunmaker drawled, but Auden didn’t reply because he could make out the TV now and could see it was his wife, or close to it: Ellaree Golden-Hair before the strands of gray and the laugh lines. Spirits could try to copy faces, but they were thought-beasts, and to them one man’s skin was as good as another. They needed specific instructions to pull off a fax this good. Auden thought her eyes were too far apart, her smile a tad too wide, but otherwise the gunmaker had captured his wife’s likeness perfectly, recalling the angles of her face and the curve of her hip. Auden decided not to dwell on it, then dwelt on it all the same.

“She left me,” the gunmaker was saying. “If you’re lookin’ for Connie, she don’t live here no more. The kids neither.”

Auden found his voice, tearing his eyes away from the spirit-fax of his wife on the screen. “Not here t’see Connie,” he rasped, and he wondered when his voice had started sounding so tired, and so old.

The gunmaker arched his back, craning against the Naugahyde to examine Auden upside down. Then his eyes widened, and he spun, stumbling to his feet, an empty mug falling from the side table and shattering on the floor. “S’that you, Auden?”

Auden nodded, finding himself unable to meet the gunmaker’s eye. “Hiya, Fulton.”

“What’re you doin’ here?” Auden expected the man to slur and stumble like a drunk, but he could sense now that this wasn’t the case, for the gunmaker was focused, sharp, his twitching fingers teasing Auden’s heart apart at the seams, and there was no color in his left eye.

Auden swallowed, studying him. If their positions had been reversed, if Ellaree chose Fulton instead, he wondered, would this be him? Or would he have gotten over her and moved on? The answer was like a lead fishing weight hooked in his heart, but he took a deep breath and said what he had to say.

“I need you to kiss my wife.”

Thirteen years after the magic came back, Auden and Ellaree had the worst fight of their lives.

They stopped trying for a baby after the third miscarriage. If it had just been a matter of trying to get pregnant, they could have gone on trying for ages, but they couldn’t stomach the thought of going through nine more soul-crushing months.

The next day Auden flagged down the horseback librarian and found some wards against fertility. He spoke the words alone that night in the shower, cupping his testicles. When the spirits answered, he felt a dull ache, mingled heartbreak and relief, and a kind of horrible guilt. As he sat there under the dribbling water, he was struck by the absurdity of the moment, a ridiculous anticlimax, the hopes and dreams of six years of marriage dashed by Auden in the shower playing with himself.

When he told Ellaree, she just nodded, not looking away from the washing, and he stood next to her taking the dishes and drying them before putting them away in the cupboard. They were close enough that their shoulders were touching, but they didn’t say anything, and Auden could feel the space between them filling up with the three baby girls they lost.

It took another year before he got frustrated enough to confront her with the fact that they never talked anymore.

“What d’you expect me to say?” she snapped, because she was frustrated too, and she didn’t know how to get her husband back.

“Something,” he yelled. “Anything! They’re gone, we gotta move on.”

But bringing up the children was a mistake, because she felt the loss even more secretly than he did, treasured her splinter of pain. She glimpsed their echoes still, a baby’s wail or eye-corner flashes of tiny running forms, and she would still rise from bed to check the empty hallway when she heard tiny shoes patter on the old hardwood.

They yelled at each other, their left pupils stretching wide to slivers of color around empty black holes as they weaved curses through the old house, the despair and pain hanging from every doorframe like translucent streamers, screaming and crying and arguing through the whole day and into the night, and afterwards Auden went to sleep on the couch, feeling angry and sick.

It was almost three in the morning when Ellaree made a ward-knife of her hand and cut through the tangled weave of their hexes, working her way to him. Wordlessly, she wiped the clinging spirits from his body, then slid under his arm and pressed close against his side.

“I’m sorry,” he said after a moment. “I love you.”

“You don’t know a thing about love,” she murmured, but she held him tighter, and for the first time in over a year, she fell asleep in his arms. The next morning, it wasn’t fixed, but somehow the edges weren’t quite so jagged.

Twenty-five years after the magic came back, Auden and the gunmaker stood over Ellaree’s body, frozen on the couch.

“Makes sense,” the gunmaker muttered. He was excited, but Auden had expected as much. Whatever their differences, he and Fulton Gunmaker had never lied about what they wanted, and there was no reason for that to change now. Auden understood what it was like to be in love with Ellaree Golden-Hair. But all the same, it didn’t stop him from feeling the urge to strangle this man who was so deliriously fated to love his wife.

“Is she aware of us? Of what’s goin’ on?” the gunmaker asked, an inventor’s curiosity as poor cover for a lover’s hesitance.

Auden shook his head. “Don’t rightly know. The shaman back in Harlan thought so. Hard to be sure.”

Fulton nodded, his gaze still on Ella’s face. “Best to uh . . . do it quick, then, I s’pose?” He perched on the couch next to her, his face half shadowed from the flickering television.

“Prob’ly so,” Auden managed, his stomach roiling as he watched Fulton lean down between Ellaree’s shielding arms. Then Fulton brushed his lips against hers.

It was immediately obvious it was going to work. All three of them felt it, the spirits felt it, everyone in Glen Allen probably felt it, decades of power and life and True Love released all in one moment. Ellaree’s body stirred, slowly at first, then the stiffness worked from her limbs as her lips responded, deepening the kiss, and her outstretched arms curled down, tightening around his neck, pulling him against her, and he kissed her fiercely as the magic worked through her body, breaking the curse with the purity of his affection, and that’s when Auden left.

He threw his things into the wagon, wadding the tarp and stuffing it under the seat with shaking hands, and he was so blinded by tears that he had to grope for the reins. He barely managed to whistle to the horse between wracking sobs, and they moved off along the cracked asphalt towards the long, deadly journey back to Harlan, trailing spirit-slaves of despair on long chains.

He went a hundred yards before he heard Ellaree calling his name. He turned in his seat, one hand covering his mouth, and he could see her sprinting after him, her ratty blue hoodie flapping behind her as she ran. He jerked the horse to a stop and struggled down from the wagon, tears streaming down his face, and then she was in his arms, holding him too tight, and her voice whispered in his ear, “Auden, honey, my Auden, you saved me, oh God, you saved me . . .” He bit his lip so hard he feared it might bleed.

After a moment, Auden gathered his strength and pulled away. She was looking up at him, her eyes shining, and she touched his face, smoothing away tears. “Oh, honey, what’s wrong? Where are you going?”

“F-Fulton. He . . .” Auden swallowed hard, speaking through hitching breaths. “He . . . loves you. More . . .” he gritted his teeth, screwing his eyes shut so he wouldn’t have to see how beautiful she was, because this was the last time he would ever see her, and it hurt too much to say, but he said it anyway. “More than I do. You should b-be with him. You . . . always shoulda . . . shoulda been with him.”

There was a pause, and when he opened his eyes again, her gaze scalded him. “Maybe so. But you’re my husband. I told him that. He understands.”

Auden shook his head, feeling more tears rising in his throat. “No. No, no, no. I can’t hold you back f-from your destiny. Not anymore.” He gritted his teeth. “The way we met . . . the way I seduced you? The kids? Oh, God, our baby girls . . .” and she winced at this, but he barreled on, reckless. “It was a sign, it was all a sign. I was gettin’ punished. And what about Fulton? You saw how he is!” He pulled back from her again, farther this time. “He loves you.”

She stood there for a long moment, frowning at him. Then she crossed her arms. “All these years, and you still don’t know a thing about love.”

Auden blinked. “What?”

“That’s still what you think love is! You and Fulton both! Whoever cares the best wins! If you follow the rules and say the right things at all the right times, that you can earn it.” She was moving towards him now, reaching up to cup his cheeks, and he was powerless to stop her. “What about what I want?”

“You . . . you want Fulton. He’s your . . .” Auden swallowed. “He’s your true love. You woulda been happier with him. Better off.”

She shook her head, giving him that half-smile. “I could have been happy with Fulton, but that doesn’t matter now.” She pressed closer to him, her elbows bending against his chest as she moved into his arms, and he held her, instinctive. “I chose you, Auden,” she said. “I told you the day you climbed through that church window, it’s about choosing to love someone, no matter what. I’m not gonna let some magic tell me who I hafta be with. You don’t hafta be good enough for me. Don’t hafta slay any dragons, climb any mountains. Just . . . love me. The best you know how. ’Cuz that’s how I love you.”

He swallowed hard, looking down at his wife, at the way her eyes searched his face, and he kissed her then, long and slow and gentle. They stood there for a long time before they mounted the wagon and set off back towards Harlan County.

On the way home they were ensnared by the bird-goddess Camulatz, who ate the heads of the first people, and she tried to have them sacrificed in the ziggurat atop Mount Rogers but found she had to let them go instead because even her obsidian teeth turned aside blunted on the skin of those touched by true love. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Caring for Dragons and Growing a Flower
By Allison Thai
31 October, 1974

Dear Thi,

Sleep easy tonight, darling. I’m well and alive at the barracks the Party had seized in Sóc Trăng. Because I had sided with the enemy, I expected to be shot, or be assigned to clear the mines. Instead, the commander told me that medical training is like imperial jade: a precious resource and hard to come by. It would be wasted, with a bullet to my head. So I renounced the treacherous ways of the enemy, and I was given the honor of caring for the dragons of the People’s Army. They’ll be the key to winning the war and driving out the American invaders. Every day we inch closer to victory and uniting our country. Every day I thank the Party for my spared life. I will henceforth contribute my efforts to the glory and prosperity of the Party.

How are things back home in Hà Nội? Have you been taking care of the seed I gave you on our wedding day?

Sincerely, Cương

30 November, 1974

Dear Cương,

I’m grateful for the commander’s mercy. I heard that dragons aren’t easy to tame. Please take care. I’m relieved the Party gained possession of all the dragons in Vietnam before the enemy could get their hands on them. Americans can’t even handle chopsticks without spilling food all over themselves, so the thought of them trying to handle dragons, our national treasures, makes me sick. The dragons are in good hands. Your hands.

As for the seed, it hasn’t sprouted yet. I’m so sorry to tell you that the lovely pot you put it in for me has a crack underneath. That’s why it leaks when I try to water the soil. I’m sure the pot you gave me was flawless. Bombs dropped by the enemy make the ground shake, so that must be to blame for the crack. I need to move the seed to another pot. A bigger, stronger home that won’t crack or leak.

With love, Thi

31 December, 1974

Dear Thi,

I’m treated well at Sóc Trăng. The pillows and blankets are so soft that the commander must’ve ordered clouds of Heaven to come down just for me. Nothing soothes the aches and chills from work in December better than hot claypot catfish and sweet potato shrimp fritters. Yours are the best, of course, though food served by the camp cooks is a close second.

These luxuries, however, only come when I fulfill the duties expected of me. You’ve known me since I moved to the city so I could learn how to treat people, but I’m back to caring for animals. Life has a funny way of returning me to my roots after I’d been branching out. But these dragons aren’t my family’s livestock — thinking that would be a mistake. I’m not fattening them up for slaughter. Instead, I must always keep them lean and sharp, in top fighting form. That means feeding them rations of red meat — parts of pigs and cows — to nurse their thirst for blood. Work up an appetite for enemy soldiers. Weaning dragons from their natural diet of fish is challenging. I also have to keep them from injuring each other. Each dragon needs space to slither around, or hair and scales would fly. Dragons enjoy gliding above the clouds, but they must be confined to the ground, constantly on tethers, so tanks and planes don’t shoot them down. This breeds bad tempers and snapping teeth that could easily take my hands. I can calm them down and save my hands if I reach their sweet spot: gaps between their impenetrable armor of scales.

Each dragon has his or her own sweet spot. [REDACTED] has a bare patch behind the horns that likes a good scratch. [REDACTED] enjoys a rub on the spine between the fifth and sixth segments of her body. [REDACTED] can’t get enough of a massage just around his noodle-like whiskers. I could go on and on with each dragon, but I don’t want to bore you and turn this letter into a novel. I’m on a quest to find all the different sweet spots. When the dragons lie still, I can see the sky caught in the globes of their eyes. Clouds swim like white koi in the ponds of their tears. When you’re privileged to be on their side, up close, you can appreciate that beauty. The enemy can only see monsters. The fangs and claws.

If you need to find a new pot, ask my uncle Vinh. He may be a fisherman, but he makes a second business of tending an army of potted plants. Uncle Vinh gets many of his pots from overseas. I had insisted to him that I give you a homemade pot for our wedding. Now I admit that an imported one would be better for our flower to-be.

Sincerely, Cương

31 January, 1975

Dear Cương,

I envy you for being assured of a good night’s rest. Planes zoom over our house like flies I can’t swat away. Dragons don’t need engines. Only the wind beneath them. Bullets and propellers don’t keep the dragons from taking down planes in their scaly coils. They swim through the sky and snatch up planes like fish. I’m sure we had won that airfight I saw last week.

Two days before I wrote this letter, the Trần family was arrested for keeping magazines that protest the Party. Mr. Trần spat at an officer’s feet, cursed our Chinese allies, and uttered obscenities against Ho Chi Minh, so he was shot just outside his home. I thought our neighbors were decent, quiet folk. If only Mr. Trần had kept his mouth shut. Now who’s going to catch and sell the freshest eels at the market? One man’s folly leaves the rest behind to suffer. There’s no thought for everyone’s good in southern sympathizers. It’s hard to trust anyone these days.

You speak of the dragons as if they’re new friends you’ve made. You keep dangerous company, but at least they seem to like you. Plants are much easier to care for, I think. Your uncle has been helping me care for the seed. Will you come home to watch it grow?

With love, Thi

28 February, 1975

Dear Thi,

As long as the enemy rebels, I must keep serving and helping the Party educate them. Sóc Trăng is my new home, and the dragons are more than friends. They’re my sons and daughters now. Like children, they need enough food, sleep, and space to keep them from squabbling. I hope you understand, darling. Unlike Mr. Trần , my loyalties are in the right place. That will keep me safe and well cared for.

We have our roles to play in this war. I must care for the dragons, and you have to grow the plant, even if I can’t be around to watch it bloom. You’ll be fine on your own. No, you’ve always been. Three years ago — three years already? — you crossed the busiest street in Hà Nội without a miss in your stride, without anyone holding your hand. Nothing and no one could hold you back — not the swarms of motorbikes, not the men who offered to escort you. By the time you reached halfway across, I knew you were the woman I wanted to marry. You can cross any street, no matter how busy and big and scary it might be.

Did you know that talking to a plant helps it grow faster? Plants don’t just feed on light and water, but on our breaths, too. Talk to the seed as much as you can. Tell it the stories we heard from the laps of our grandparents. Tell it about the fairy queen, her one hundred eggs, and her eldest son who became our first emperor. Tell it about the golden turtle in the lake. And tell it about the dragons.

You say otherwise, but I think that caring for dragons and growing a flower aren’t so different. We’ll fuss over them for a while, but not forever. From the ground we nurse them in, dragons and flowers have only one way to go: up, up, up, towards the sky. I know that our seed will grow into a beautiful flower. Already in my dreams, I see it bloom with all the colors of a rainbow.

Sincerely, Cương

31 March, 1975

Dear Cương,

Forgive me, I shouldn’t be selfish in wishing you could come home. You are home. All of Vietnam is our home, even the rebellious south that insists on keeping us divided. I know you’re working hard to make the southerners open their eyes.

Trời ơi, Cương, I think you keep forgetting that I’m hardly the first city girl to cross a busy street; I was just the first city girl you had seen. You were a scared, lost farm boy, late on your first day of training at the hospital nearby. Still, you held out your sunbaked hand, offering to help me cross. I said yes, but only because I wanted to help you across! The neighbors still laugh when I tell them the story.

You fell in love with me when I crossed the street in Hà Nội. I love you for your wisdom. You came to the city lost but filled with good sense from the rice fields. That’s why your trousers were so loose and baggy. There wasn’t enough room in your head, so you carried proverbs and good advice in your pockets. Do you whisper them to the dragons? Do they listen?

I’ve been talking to the seed in its new pot since you sent your last letter. The seed’s not a shoot yet, but I’ll keep talking. I’ll tell the stories over and over. I’ll tell it all about you whenever I miss you.

With love, Thi

Dear Cương,

I’m sorry that it took this long to get a letter to you. I’m on American soil. It’s firm, steady, and doesn’t shake under my feet from the bombs and mines. I’m free to say whatever I want. Finally, no more dodgy, coded talk of pots and plants and flowers and seeds. But so much has happened that I don’t know where to begin. All I can think to do is write down what we’d been unable to say in our past letters: our baby girl’s name, in big bold letters taking up their own sheet of paper.

HUỆ

August 31, 1975

Dear Cương,

A month in Houston seems like a lifetime without you. I’ve been burning letters with Vinh’s cigarette lighter so the smoke can carry what I say up to you, wherever you may be. I owe Vinh a lifetime of gratitude for stowing me and Huệ away on his boat so we could escape Vietnam. Of course, I owe you a thousand lifetimes over for pointing me to him. “Thank you” is such a tiny pair of words, almost an insult.

That was the only English I knew when I had set foot into America. I must’ve made our sponsors’ ears fall off with my broken-record English. Vinh knows a handful of basic phrases, so we get by. I plan to learn English quickly and get off welfare as soon as I can. Vinh will move to Galveston where he’ll keep fishing and shrimping.

America is missing things that make me long for home. No one sells eels or chicken feet. Nobody drives a motorbike on the freeway. No one takes off their shoes inside the house. Strange new foods, words, customs — the spin and swirl of it makes me dizzy, like motorbikes at a roundabout in Hà Nội. This is the busy street you were so scared of, Cương. It’s my turn to be scared now. I wish you could help me across.

With love, Thi

September 31, 1975

Dear Cương,

I try to write letters every day, but it’s impossible. If I start writing, I end up tearing apart unfinished drafts. I’ve been censoring myself. I think you’d get tired of hearing the same thing. I’ve gathered up a few months’ worth of frustrations and unfortunate events: I’m still being corrected in what seems like a hundred times a day on my pronunciation. I want to choke my English tutor. I don’t think I’ll pass the citizenship test. I’m still living off food stamps. I can’t get out of my dishwashing job. Vinh’s fishing boat in Galveston was burned by men in pointed white masks. Huệ’s having all sorts of trouble in kindergarten. She’s not doing her homework and hasn’t made any friends. Yesterday she got suspended for biting on a boy’s ear. The boy pulled back his eyes at her — still, she almost bit his ear off. What should I do with her, Cương? We put in so much work to pluck her from violence back home only for her to find it in America.

I wish you were here. It’s not your fault that you can’t be. I hate the dragons for taking you away from me and Huệ. Did you have to lie in your letters, too? Did you really eat and sleep well at the barracks in Sóc Trăng, or were you held at gunpoint to say that?

Where are you, Cương? Vinh and I hadn’t heard anything of you, let alone from you, since we came to America. I don’t know if you’re dead or alive. Are you still a dragon medic at Sóc Trăng? Are you up in the sky, flying free with the dragons that didn’t last through the war? Or are you just buried in unmarked dirt on the other side of the world? I have too many questions, and you’re not here to answer any of them.

With love, Thi

September 31, 1975

Dear Cương,

I was going to burn the letter I wrote in September when rain poured down. I thought it was the usual bout of rain in Houston, but I tasted salt on my lips. That wasn’t rain. Those were tears. Could they be yours, Cương? Were you crying with me? For me? Or are they dragon tears?

I shouldn’t hate the dragons. They were victims, too. Unwilling participants in a war that twisted them into bloodthirsty killing machines. According to the local radio channel, the population came close to being wiped out by the fall of Saigon. Vietnamese dragons may be extinct soon. Huệ may very well never see one. I’d forget that before the war, since the dawn of our country’s history, dragons brought rain to us when we needed to keep our rice fields green. The war made them forget how to water the crops, and forget what the skies and seas were like before the invasion of planes and ships. I didn’t expect dragons to fly this far. Thank you for sending them to me, Cương. I can’t see them, but I like to think that they came. Fighting and killing turned dragon rain into tears. Maybe forever.

Huệ joined me in the backyard and cried into my skirt. She said she’ll try harder in school. Standing in the rain makes her feel better because no one can see her tears. She gets that from me.

I won’t burn any more letters. Dragon tears fell before I ever lit up the paper. You must’ve read my heart. That’s enough for me to know that you came all the way here.

With love, Thi

August 26, 1976

Dear Ba,

This is Huệ. I am starting first grade today. Má stopped writing letters but I have to write in my journal every day at school. I will write in English for my teacher. I will write in Vietnamese for you. Maybe I can teach you English like I am teaching Má.

It was raining when Má kissed me goodbye next to the bus. She kissed me on my left cheek my right cheek then my forehead. That means she is really happy. She got a new job, and Uncle Vinh has a new boat. Other kids do not like getting wet, but I do. Rain means that you came down with the dragons to kiss me goodbye too.

Today for art my class had to draw self-portraits. That is a big word for pictures of ourselves. I drew myself as a flower in a pot. I used all my crayons for the petals. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. Colors of the rainbow. My teacher Ms. Johnson said that was not right. She said that does not look like me. I am supposed to have two arms and two legs and hair. Not a stem and leaves and petals. Má talked and talked with Ms. Johnson after class. She told Ms. Johnson my favorite story. The story with you in it. I heard it so many times but I like hearing it again. Má does not have the letters from you anymore but she remembers every word on them.

After hearing the story Ms. Johnson did not make me redo my self-portrait. It stopped raining this afternoon. That’s okay. I’m not sad. You and the dragons will come back to see me. It rains a lot in Houston. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Salt and Iron
By Gem Isherwood
There’s a gash across her cheekbone, glass in her arm and her lower lip is twice the size it should be, but Dagna Müller is hardly a stranger to pain.

She slumps on the steps outside the tavern, feeling her nose to check if it’s broken again. Without sensation in her fingertips it’s hard to tell. She can’t bring herself to care much either way.

Her muscles ache from the weight as well as the fight: a dull hurt that courses along her shoulders and down her arms, turning to a chafing burn where the skin of her wrists meets the solid metal of her hands.

That pain never fades. At least the injuries provide some variety.

The tavern stands on the seafront, where barques and schooners are berthed like horses stabled for the night. The tide is low and the air reeks worse than an undine’s armpit; between that and the cheap gin in her belly it takes all of Dagna’s willpower not to retch.

Six months ago, she wouldn’t have lost a fight. If she hadn’t drunk herself halfway into oblivion she could have knocked all three of them out inside of a minute. Or at least noticed the bastards were cheating before they’d taken every last coin in her purse.

“Here,” a voice says from above her. “You’re a damn poor advertisement for my business.”

She looks up to see the landlord – an old mariner, face wrinkled from the sun and sea air – offering her an almost-clean rag. She takes it and dabs at her bloody face.

“I’ll pay for the damage,” she says, busted lip muffling the words.

“Oh yeah? With what?” He leans against the doorframe and folds his arms. “Them’s good hands for throwing a punch. Strong arms for throwing weight behind it too.”

“Four years on the merchant ships’ll do that.”

The glass splinters in her left bicep are leaking spots of blood like freckles. She’ll have to dig them out with a penknife later. It’s times like these she misses fingernails.

“Yeah,” the landlord grins, “I’ve heard of you, Ironhands Müller. I heard you’ve pissed off every captain from here to Seligheim with your brawling and now there’s none’ll sail with you. I heard you broke a navigator’s face in eight places, and I didn’t even know there were eight separate bits of a face that could break.”

“There are if you count teeth.”

The landlord’s eyes crinkle when he laughs. He has an anchor and two nautical stars tattooed on his own wiry arm, crudely executed and faded with age. Many sailors bear similar designs, but Dagna does not share their love for the sea. The salt irritates the skin at her wrists and flays her temper red-raw.

She remembers when she found tattooed sailors coarse and frightening. She remembers when she would rather cower than fight. She tastes her own blood at her lip and thinks of the stubborn flecks of rust that won’t come off her hands no matter how hard she scrubs.

Salt and iron. This is what she’s made of now.

“Cards is no way to make money, girl,” the landlord says, coming to sit beside her on the steps. “You know every reprobate around here has aces stashed up their sleeves. Right next to the daggers in most cases.”

Dagna scowls, and the movement sends a burst of pain along her cheek. What is she supposed to do? Sit with a begging bowl like the poor old wretch outside the Three Mermaids, who embellishes his story of falling from the crow’s nest to soften hearts and loosen purse strings?

She has begged too many times. Never again.

The landlord looks at her with the exasperated affection a father might bestow on a mischievous child. She can’t stand the sight of it.

“If it’s gold you need…” he says. “You ever heard of Silberwald? Small town, about two days’ ride west of here?”

“Sounds like a shithole.”

It’s a lie, of sorts. She knows the place, or at least the name. She grew up only a few miles away on the other side of the forest, but her father would never take her to the market or the midsummer fair. She once asked for his leave to go alone and he confiscated her shoes for a month.

“Place went and got itself cursed by Themselves about three months back,” the landlord explains. “Bad business.”

“You’re really selling it to me, old man.”

“Big reward for anyone who can break the curse, I hear. And it won’t end with you locked up for affray.”

Dagna glances up at that. All those brawls, all those punches thrown, and she hasn’t once considered the law. She supposes she hasn’t cared enough, not for a long time. At least in gaol you know where your next meal is coming from.

“What makes you think I could break a fairy curse?” she asks.

He nods at her hands and smiles. “You can pay me for the damage once it’s done.”

Dagna Müller is fifteen when the lord comes to her cottage. He arrives on a pale grey mare, dressed in a suit of spidersilk, his fingers and earlobes dripping with stones fashioned from dewdrops and moonlight. He is the most magnificent thing she has ever seen, but Themselves have not sent an emissary to bless her house with good fortune.

Her father, worse for drink, stumbled too far from the path three nights back and pissed on a fairy mound.

“I will take your daughter’s hand,” the lord says in a voice like mist and starlight, “as recompense for this most grave of insults.”

Dagna does not miss the way his lip curls in eagerness. Perhaps it is no insult at all, merely a convenient excuse. The lord does not want her for a bride, she knows, but a toy; one he will play with roughly until she breaks. He might let her go, eventually. Perhaps her father or her brother will find her years from now, a wizened, witless husk wasting away for want of enchanted fruit and her tormentor’s touch.

So, this is what she’s worth, then. What her life will be measured against. The steam off a drunkard’s piss.

She tries to stay calm, to think. It is useless looking to her father for protection. She remembers last winter, when he locked her out in two feet of snow because she’d forgotten to mend a tear in his shirt. He’d made her say sorry one hundred times before he let her in. “I don’t think you meant that,” he’d called to her after every attempt. “Try again.”

She’d done it too; begged and begged, clawing at the door with frostbitten fingers. Each whimpered plea was like spitting out a blade.

No, Dagna Müller will not beg again.

Instead she raises her chin, meets the lord’s silver eyes and says: “At least let me say goodbye to Karl.”

She finds her little brother chopping wood behind the cottage, his arms barely strong enough to lift the axe. She kneels and lays her hands on the chopping block, palms down.

“Dagna, what–”

“Cut them off.”

He flinches, afraid of the wild and terrible look on his sister’s face. It is the first time anyone has looked at her like that. She already knows it will not be the last. But she cannot waste time weeping or trembling; neither will do any good.

“If you love me,” she says, “cut them off.”

Karl does his best to make the cuts neat, although his own hands shake around the handle of the axe. There is blood on Dagna’s gown, on the block and the grass, and he carries her to the woodwife’s house leaving a trail of it on the ground.

The woodwife swiftly sees to Dagna’s wounds and instructs her husband, the blacksmith, to fashion a pair of iron hands in his forge. When they have cooled, she seals them onto Dagna’s wrists and grants them animation, though the simple magic of a woodwife is for delivering children and soothing coughs in winter, and the joins are poorly done. The metal chafes – will always chafe – when Dagna dares to move.

“This is better,” the woodwife says, the closest to an apology Dagna will ever get. “It is better than Themselves.”

Dagna Müller returns home as if from the battlefield, dressed in her own drying blood. Her father’s mouth gapes in shock, then in anger, but Dagna keeps her eyes fixed on the lord as she stretches out one of her new, iron hands.

The woodwife’s magic keeps the pain at bay for now but the metal is heavy, a straining pull along her arm and across her shoulders. A fly buzzes around her wrist, attracted by the blood. She feels less like prey than carrion.

“Here then,” she tells the lord. “If you want it, take it.”

The lord laughs, clapping like a child. “Oh, well done, Dagna Müller. Oh, how delightfully clever!”

Yet there is a tremor beneath his words, behind those silver eyes. Even if Dagna’s hands were made of wood or moulded clay he would not take her now – Themselves would not want a flawed mortal, even as a toy – but there is just as much fear in him as revulsion. That, at least, is a victory.

Dagna’s iron hands are deadly. Her touch will bring only pain.

Her father, furious at her defiance and fearful of the lord’s retribution, will beat Karl in her absence. Dagna knows it and sorrows for it, but she knows she does not belong here now.

The fly leaves her wrist and lands on the tip of her iron thumb. She brings the index finger close and it barely takes any effort to crush the creature to powder and grease.

She walks all the way to Silberwald, napping in hedgerows and hollow trees. The landlord gives her a little food and a small bottle of ointment for her cuts and she rations both carefully. By the time she is in sight of the forest her injuries no longer grieve her.

Ironhands Müller is fit for the next fight.

Silberwald lies on the forest’s edge, frosted firs curling around the cottages like a protective arm. Her father’s cottage lies just on the other side of that forest, but Dagna refuses to think of it. The drink has probably finished him off by now, that or his own folly. For Karl’s sake, she hopes so.

She makes her way into the main square, where they hold the markets and the fairs she’d once begged her father to see, but there is no market today.

All of the townspeople wear blindfolds; strips of fabric roughly torn from aprons and the hems of skirts. They move slowly, fearfully, calling to one another for reassurance. It looks almost like a game, but Dagna suspects there are no willing players.

At the edge of the square a boy walks holding a long, thin branch in front of him, moving it in a sweeping motion and pausing whenever it hits an obstacle. The knee of his breeches is torn, the skin beneath badly grazed.

To Dagna’s left, a small girl skips with a ragged rope, her feet landing hard on the ground. The impact shakes her blindfold free and she blinks in the light, the rope falling still in her hands.

Then she catches sight of her mother, standing a few feet away, and she screams.

Instantly her mother darts forward, arms outstretched, following the sound. She grabs her daughter’s shoulders and forces her to the ground, pinning her down as she reties the blindfold, and all the while the child howls as though she has foreseen her own death.

Dagna retreats from the square and heads straight for the master’s house. She does not wish to frighten these people further, and she forgot long ago how to be anything else but frightening.

The door is answered by a girl her own age, though she is not dressed in servant’s clothes. Her hair is red as embers, her skin pale as the inside of a seashell. When she turns her head, her eyes look like two opals; cloudy, beautiful and sightless.

“I wish to speak to your master,” Dagna says.

“I am master here. You may call me Lady Karin.”

She sweeps into the house without another word, certain that Dagna will follow.

Dagna knows the girl is no lady. She speaks with the accent of a peasant. The dress, fine-spun wool in midnight blue, was not made to fit her form.

But if Karin expects Dagna to take her for a lady, then perhaps she will accept Dagna as a hero.

“I am Dagna Müller,” she announces, “called Ironhands, and I have come to break the curse upon this town.”

Karin approaches her, holding out her own pale hands. Bracing for the flinch, the gasp of horror, Dagna takes them.

But Karin only lifts an eyebrow as she feels the solid iron, as her fingers move up to the place where metal meets flesh. “Witchcraft?”

Dagna nods, before remembering. “Yes.”

“Not very good witchcraft, I think.” She brushes her fingertips over the heated, swollen skin. “Does it hurt?”

“Always.”

Dagna feels Karin’s fingers twitch. There is something in the word the girl seems to recognise; a bitter note, perhaps, or its weary honesty. Dagna does and does not want to ask why.

“Tell me about the curse,” she says instead.

Karin moves away, skimming a hand along the tabletop to guide herself across the room. “Three months ago, when the king and his retinue were passing by the forest, Themselves stole the young prince away underground. Only the people of Silberwald know the safe paths through these woods, so Themselves made sure we would never be able to show any would-be rescuers the way.”

“They blinded the villagers?”

Karin laughs with cold glee. “Oh, they aren’t blind. But they don’t see the world right any more. Rotten food appears fresh and good. Slippery banks are straight paths. Their own children, their own spouses, are hideous monsters coming to devour them. If they lift those blindfolds they see only a world full of tricks and horrors.

“Themselves spared me,” she adds blithely. “They think I do not know the way.”

That, Dagna thinks, and they despise irregularity. They would not have wished to get close enough to a girl like Karin to curse her.

“I could help,” she says. “I could rescue the prince. If you would show me–”

“No.”

“No?”

“The royal brat stays where he is.”

“But–”

“Shall I tell you what I did with the last hero who came to me, bragging he could save us all? I summoned the farrier, one of our strongest men. I told him this brave hero could cure his affliction, if only he would lift his blindfold. He did, saw a terrible monster and slew the hero where he stood. The poor fool was so confused afterwards. I thanked him for coming to my aid and he only mumbled that I was welcome and left.”

Dagna stares. “Why would you do that?”

“Before, I had to beg in the streets,” Karin snaps. “Make myself humble and pitiful for the sake of a coin or cast-off rags. Then Themselves came, and suddenly I was the one the town came crying to. ‘Dear Karin, how can we find food?’ ‘Sweet Karin, how can we stay safe?’ When the old master drowned in a river he took for a stone bridge, I demanded they let me take his house. They didn’t like it, but they had no choice. They depend on my charity now.” Her face sets in such stern resolve she might as well be made of stone. “And I would keep it this way.”

It is so easy, Dagna thinks, to flay a girl. Barbed words can do it, or fists, or the bite of winter frost. It is even easier to turn away and make a girl do it to herself. Karin has been hardened, the way the salt air once hardened Dagna. What makes Dagna burn red-hot with anger has turned Karin’s heart cold.

“Go home, Dagna Müller,” Karin says, softer now. “These people are not worth your courage.”

Dagna has been known only as Ironhands for so long it is strange to hear her true name spoken aloud. She wonders what she would do, what she might give, for Karin to say it again.

“I don’t have a home,” she says. “That’s why I need the gold. Help me find the prince and I’ll split the reward with you. You could make the king send bodyguards to protect you. Or demand the prince marry you instead.”

“I have made myself master here. Why should I ask for a master of my own?”

Dagna thinks of the boy in the square, the sweep of his tree branch before every step.

“Because they’ll learn. Like you did. They won’t stumble about helpless forever. And you are alone. If your own townsfolk don’t depose you, others will learn how vulnerable you are. They’ll put you back in your place, Lady Karin. Do nothing, and you’ll beg again.”

“I will not.”

“I have made that same promise to myself. I know how this feels. I know.”

Karin is silent for a long time.

“You may stay here tonight,” she says eventually. “As my guest. Eat something. Bathe, if you like. I will consider what you have said.”

Hungry and filthy from the road, Dagna does as she is bid. She is sure to face the door while she bathes, but she does not fear attack. She carries her weapons with her. She can never be rid of them.

Later, Karin fetches food and lights candles for the benefit of her guest. Dagna notices her eyes are rimmed with red, as though she has cried so much the rawness has never healed. She half-expects the food to be poisoned until Karin takes the first bite; a show of trust, a gesture of solidarity.

Girls of salt and iron can understand each other, at least a little.

“Why did you tell me the truth?” Dagna asks, when the food is finished and the candles have burned low. “Why didn’t you send for the farrier to slay me too?”

Karin pauses before answering. “Because when I said I was master here, you did not laugh at me.”

Dagna looks at Karin in the fading light. She could kill her now, for the townspeople’s sake, and risk the forest alone. It would only take a little squeeze; the long neck, or the skull. But as she takes in Karin’s hair, her skin with its seashell lustre, her eyes the colour of the northern seas when a storm tosses the waves, she knows she could not bear to hurt something so beautiful.

The woodwife’s charm lasts less than a week after Dagna leaves her father’s cottage. Once it fades the pain at her wrists stays as fresh as the day the cuts were made. She tells herself that this is better, even when it hurts so much she cannot sleep. It is better than Themselves.

Three weeks later, as she is travelling towards the coast to find work, she meets a boy.

She finds him lounging by a river, his fishing rod abandoned on the bank. He bids her stay awhile, and they talk.

The boy is pretty and charming, and he makes Dagna forget the pain at her wrists, those rough joins that still smell of rust, or blood, or both. She wears gloves now to conceal her hands, soft cotton things she stole from a washing line, and for a while she can pretend she is an ordinary girl.

When he kisses her she kisses back, startling him with her fierceness and her need. She feels him smile against her lips and presses him down into the grass. Her gloved hands roam across his collarbones, his tanned arms, over his chest and down–

Something snaps. The boy screams.

“I’m sorry!” she says, scrambling off him, horrorstruck. “Please, I’m so sorry.”

He glares at her, clutching his ribs, and she falls silent. She knows sorry is never good enough, not if you say it a hundred times.

“What’s wrong with you?” the boy snarls. “What are you?”

I don’t think you meant that. Try again.

The pain at her wrists is sharp once more; pain that burns so hot it feels like rage.

She beats his pretty face until he lies still and quiet, then throws the bloodied gloves into the river.

From that day on she leaves her hands exposed, like a warning.

She wakes to find Karin nudging her with the tip of a wooden cane. It is almost dawn, and the girl’s red hair is covered by a hooded cloak.

“Themselves bring the prince aboveground every morning,” she says. “If mortals are starved of fresh air they wither before they stop being fun.”

“You’ll show me the way?” Dagna asks. “You’ll let me try?”

“Do not give me cause to regret it.”

The forest is full of sounds and shadows, eyes and claws, but Karin knows the path as Dagna knows the Seligheim coastline. She uses her cane like the boy in the square used his branch, but faster, with more skill. Every wrong turn, every fall and bruise and sprain and scare has been a lesson, a scrap of knowledge hard-won.

She leads Dagna to a clearing where the young prince stands, glassy-eyed and exhausted. He is guarded by a figure on a pale grey mare; a man dressed in spidersilk, with shining silver eyes.

When they fall on Dagna, the lord does not look surprised.

It is as if he set this trap just for her, waiting for the tale to spread as far as the coast: a cursed town, the promise of gold, and a task designed for a girl with iron strength.

All this time, she thinks. All these years she has been a debt outstanding, and he cannot bear it.

“I asked for your hand once, Dagna Müller,” the lord says. “Now let me make you an offer.”

He takes a bundle of cloth from his saddlebag and unwraps it. Inside are two small, fine-boned human hands. They might have been taken from some other poor girl. They might even have belonged to Dagna herself, stolen from the bloodstained chopping block and preserved with unnatural magic.

“Think of it. No more pain. No more ugliness. Forget the king’s paltry reward and accept this most generous of gifts.”

Dagna looks again at the prince. She knows she can hold him here until the lord gives in. But she also knows, stripling of a thing that he is, that holding him will break him. Ribs will splinter, collarbones will crack like twigs, and the king will grant no reward for a shattered corpse. She thinks of the boy by the river; those fearful eyes, that sickening snap.

Karin steps forward, gripping her cane like the handle of a sword. “You promised. Dagna Müller. You promised me.”

“The irregular one is jealous,” the lord hisses. “She wants you to suffer as she does. See, see what I offer you.”

Dagna reaches out until her iron fingertips brush those pretty hands, but Themselves do not forget a slight. If she wants them, he’ll make her cower and simper and debase herself to get them. If he had found her that day by the riverbank she might even have let him.

But the salt air has left her skin tanned and hardened since then, and four years of toil have made her arms thick with muscle. Those hands would be a poor fit now.

“Only ask me prettily, Dagna Müller,” says the lord. “Ask me ever so sweetly, and I shall make you whole again.”

Karin snarls like a wild thing, like this forest belongs to her and he is trespassing. “She’s no less whole than when she had them, you twisted bastard.”

The words cut through Dagna’s thoughts like the blade of an axe, like something that takes away and gives all at once.

She steps forward. The prince trembles with hope and fear, bracing himself for the pain.

“Do not be afraid,” she whispers.

Then, with one swift, sharp movement, she drags the lord from his horse and she holds.

“Karin,” she says. “Take the prince. Go now, fast as you can.”

“What’s happening?”

“Trust me. Go.”

“Let me guide you,” the prince says, clutching at Karin’s arm.

Karin shrugs him off and sprints from the clearing, dead leaves and fir needles scattering in the wake of her cane. The prince has no choice but to follow, and Dagna does not blame him for not looking back.

The horse is gone too, bolted or vanished into the air. Dagna and the lord are locked together, skin to metal, skin to skin.

He squirms first in revulsion, then in agony. He turns to a serpent, a writhing ferret, a snapping wolf in her grip, but wherever her fingers touch the iron burns. He screams curses, then offers her gifts beyond her dreams if she will only let go. She will have riches, or magic, or life eternal. She will have his devotion, his undying love.

Dagna’s own body strains to pull away, every nerve signalling her to flee. She feels the tear of muscle, as though she might rip herself free from her hands, but still she clings.

She does not look at the hands, splayed on the forest floor like fleshy white spiders. Not even the beetles will go near them.

She feels the lord’s strength waning, senses his desperation. His screams turn to choked sobs, then faint whimpers.

Then, whether to provoke compassion or fear, she does not know, he transforms into her father. A perfect replica, right down to the stink of beer and old sweat, every feature exactly as she remembers it. The lord can only hold the glamour for a moment or two, weak as he is, but it is enough.

Her hands tremble. For a moment, her grip slackens.

“Please,” the lord says in her father’s voice. “Please, Dagna, it hurts.”

“Say sorry then.” She squeezes tighter than ever, feeling both the glamour and his flesh burn away until she is gripping brittle, blackening bone. “Say you’re sorry for all you’ve done.”

“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry. Be kind to me, Dagna Müller. Be merciful. Please.”

Dagna looks down at the withered, charred thing lying limp in her hands. He is small as a child now, small as a doll.

“I’m sorry!” he cries again, shrieking, shrinking. “I’m sorry!”

“I don’t think you meant that,” she answers, and there is midwinter frost in her voice. “Try again.”

She clamps a hand over his mouth and does not lift it until there is nothing of him but powder and grease.

In the end it is not Dagna but Karin who is hailed as the saviour of Silberwald. It is Karin, after all, who leads the prince out of the forest, bathed in a halo of morning sunlight. It is Karin who urges the townsfolk to remove their blindfolds and see the world made right again.

And once the king has given Dagna her gold, and Dagna has sent a portion of it back to the tavern on the seafront, she is more than happy to let Karin take the rest of his reward.

There are some in the town who resent all that Karin has now. A title. The deeds to the house, with coins to fill the coffers the drowned master left empty. Fine clothes that fit her form, made with rich dyes and silver thread.

But they know better than to protest. They know that Silberwald is no longer a place where blind women survive on scraps.

“Will you stay?” Karin asks as she and Dagna sit under the shade of the firs, sharing a bottle of wine from her newly-stocked cellar. Children run freely across the grass nearby, arguing over which of them will play their fearless lady and which the fairy lord she bested in their games of pretend.

“The king has given you bodyguards,” Dagna says.

“I don’t want you for a bodyguard. You could have a home here.”

Dagna sets down her cup and turns away. How can she explain when Karin says such things, her lips stained red with wine? That the girl she is now was forged in violence, that violence is all she knows. That the pain in her wrists will not leave her, not for as long as she lives. That she is hot as a forge and Karin is cold as the northern seas, and girls of salt and iron are too far gone to ever be gentle again.

Then Karin takes Dagna’s hands and presses a kiss to each palm. Her kisses contain so much tenderness Dagna almost imagines she can feel them. Karin’s hands trail upwards, skimming carefully over the place where metal meets flesh, until they are cupping Dagna’s face like it is something fragile and precious.

Her touch is a rescue. Her kiss is the most generous of gifts.

“Please,” Dagna says, “do that again.”

“Please,” Karin answers, “stay a while longer.”

It is the last time either of them ever has to beg. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> While Dragons Claim the Sky
By Jen Brown
When a breeze shook the reed curtains in mama’s salon, I thought it might be another dragon gliding low, stopping to drink from Lake Mritil. ‘Course, mama and I weren’t afraid; we loved watching them soar overhead, wings gusting hard enough to free cotton fibers and coffee cherries across Gyrixëan farms, so that croppers only had to scoop them up.

So, you can imagine my disappointment when it wasn’t a dragon aloft, but a lanky huntress pushing into mama’s parlor. She burst through our straw door, letting in the noon sound of Gyrixëans haggling over pouches in the nearby spice house; testing winter tunics in the adjacent tailor’s gallery — but this wasn’t any old villager, like the rest of them.

Her wolf-pelt cloak, engraved walking staff, and curved daggers marked her as a traveler. And instead of looking journey-weary, her umber skin practically glowed beneath the gauzy afternoon light.

“Dragon’s ass!” she exclaimed, lilting accent stretching the vowels. “And I thought I wouldn’t find another black coif mage before I hit the goblin ferries.”

Mama couldn’t hear anything while her Sight was up. She was busy slicking greased fingers through Ama’ktu’s ‘locs, plying the hidden gossamer magicks that only us mages could materialize, to try and loosen the old woman’s phlegm. A few quick blinks sealed away her powers, returning sound and touch and every other sense the Sight dampened.

“What’d you say?” Mama asked.

“I’m looking to get Han’enfol twists. The long, chunky kind.” Pressing inside, the girl flung cold and snow and mud across our best mats. “Signpost says you specialize in healing coiffery, yeah? I’ve got a bad back that needs tending before I leave tonight. D’you take walk-ins?”

“Omani and I take payment for services offered.” Mama flicked her head in my direction. “Black opal, benitoite, copper stones. Even upland banknotes if you have ‘em.” Her lips flattened into an unimpressed line. “But I’ll bet you haven’t so much as a pebble on you, little girl.”

“Little?” The huntress snorted. “My eighteenth name day just passed, ma’am — ”

“Then you’ve adult currency, girl?”

She frowned, chin stabbing upward. “I will soon enough — ”

“Pah! I knew it.” Mama motioned her away. “Out.”

I hardly cared about the argument brewing. Instead, I was nestled on one of the salon’s colorful divans, neglecting all of my responsibilities — cleaning the wash basins, beating our yarn dyed throws so that waiting clients would go “Oh, how soft!” — to re-read a letter delivered via messenger raven last week:

 

From:

Mistress Carolyn Ames

Department Chair, Coif Magery

Imperial College of Allied Mages

 

To:

Omani Sudyha of the Gyrixëan underland,

Upon reviewing your application, I found your provincial use of “wish” magery an interesting method for the study of hair magicks. Therefore, I am pleased to offer you admission —

 

“Now, hold it ma’am!” The huntress backpedaled. “I can pay you easily in three days’ time!”

While mama and Ama’ktu fell out with laughter, I shimmied deeper into the divan, swathing myself in daydreams of meeting Ames; seeing the College’s campus. My imagination fissured around the letter’s last line:

At your earliest convenience, have your sponsor contact the bursar’s office to arrange payment for Fall term. 

Only a fool would apply to the empire’s oldest Department of Coif Magery, under a Professor who’d pioneered hair magicks for thirty-odd years, without having any idea how to pay for it — yet, that’s exactly what I’d done.

“I’m serious,” the huntress barked, loud enough to draw my gaze. “As a finalist in the Dragonscale Melées, I’m this close to becoming an imperial knightess. My winnings’d be large enough to pay back your kindness twice over!”

My next breath stuttered. “Wait,” I cut in, sitting up. “The melée in Ecrouxvér?”

Visiting merchers often spun tales of a biennial, three-day brawl in the floating uplands; one that covered the Imperial College’s outdoor amphitheater in white tents, while competitors sparred in gleaming armaments — competitors who often traveled with groups of tailors and smithies and pageboys. Could this melée be one and the same?

“Yeah,” the girl replied. “I’ve got a summons to prove it.”

Bolting upright, I practically toppled a stool near my legs. “I’ll do your hair!” I blurted, choking mama and Ama’ktu’s side chatter off. “If you’ll take me on retainer as your personal coif mage during the melée.”

Everything went eerily quiet as mama’s bone comb cracked to the floor. I abandoned the divan, rounding styling shelves and low tables to plead my case before the would-be knightess. After all, I’d wished for this; I’d cast my want into the hidden magicks netting our world, hoping a tuition-sized miracle might appear. And bumping into a huntress on her way to the empire’s largest tourney — who, if victorious, would receive an audience with the Empress and her favor, all at once?

That’s how mages won Imperial College scholarships.

“Omani, what foolishness are you on about?” Mama demanded. “You would make for Ecrouxvér now, while your nanu lies sick upstairs?” Her gold lip stud trembled; cowrie braids clanked, as she shook her head. “You would leave us behind?”

Heat flared my neck. Nanu was dying, and from a malady nobody understood. It couldn’t have been age, because that simply thinned her coiled tresses and creased her complexion, making prunes of her dimpled cheeks. No, this death stole her from us memory by memory; made her gurgle wetly as she forgot our faces.

Gods. I didn’t want to leave either of them.

“I know the timing’s bad, but …” Loosing a long, slow breath, I handed mama my acceptance letter. “I got in.” Her thick brows only crumpled as she read the parchment.   “I got into the Imperial College! And if I’m to accept, I need a patron who’ll cover my yearly tuition. You know who awards at least three incoming mages with Imperial College scholarships? The Empress herself.”

This time, mama’s laughter pitched high. It made her stagger and clutch Ama’ktu for support, before shifting into fury. “You think I took on Zareb’s cropping so that you could abandon us?” Mama barreled toward me then. “‘Mani, I do it so you don’t have to. So that you can keep our magery alive here.”

“Well maybe I wanna make it so you don’t have to crop!” I yelled.

Mama stopped, reeling like I’d struck her, and my whole body trembled as the truth rushed free. As if I needed reminding that papa was gone; the evidence was all around us. After he passed, ma took up his cropping rotations to cover our debts: coffee, cotton — all Gyrixë’s best-known exports. I hated that she picked year ‘round, only to send half her haul to the cloud ferries for upland distribution.

“Attending the College would mean graduating alongside nobility,” I reasoned, slicing the silence with calmer tones. “And I’d make good money doing upland heads with my wish magery. Every stone could help buy back our lands.”

“Mama threw up her hands. “Worrying about finances is my job, ‘Mani. Yours? Is not to lie like you have!” She slumped, tiredness etching itself into her slackening expression. “How could you keep all of this from me?”

Movement prickled the edge of my vision; I caught the huntress glaring between us, backing away as if she regretted stumbling in at all.

“Stay!” I barked at her. “Ma, please — ”

“No.” Her gaze turned glassy. “You wanna go? Fine. Gon ‘head. Join your new friend. Honor your ridiculous contract.”

“I haven’t agreed to anything!” The huntress bellowed.

“But don’t you dare come back here after it all blows up in your face.”

Backpedaling, I fought the angry comebacks scrabbling at my throat. I could tell she meant every word from the way she clutched her arms, like she was already getting used to holding herself up without me.

Guess I’d have to learn to do the same.

“Knightess-hopeful — ” Don’t cry, I commanded myself. Don’t.

“It’s Myra,” the girl replied. She’d been halfway out the door before mama’s ultimatum, but lingered now, fingers playing at the mosaic tapestry on her left.

“Myra, then.” I gripped my hands ‘til the nail beds whitened. “Look, I’m the best coif mage you’ll find in Gyrixë. I’ve mastered healing coiffery, and I even made up a new kind of magery when scalp divination and strand summoning didn’t suit me.”

Myra edged back inside, trailing her guarded gaze along the length of me. “Then your coif magery …?”

“Molds your wildest wishes into the fabric of our world, so they might come to life.”

A smirk plumped her dark cheeks; sharpened her now-expectant gaze. Behind us, Ama’ktu began coughing anew. Mama went to comfort her, but the din of it all sounded far away.

“Take me on retainer, but keep your winnings,” I continued. “In return, I’ll twist wishes into your hair every day of the melée. Just give me a chance to make my wish a reality.”

That night, I feigned strength as we rode out beneath a gloomy half-moon; as Gyrixë’s farmhouses, quiet windmills, and wending streams faded behind us. Once we hit Han’enfol, and our neighboring realm’s tarped night markets came into view, Myra slowed us to a trot to clear the bazaar’s throng. That’s when I spied the fire lamp glow of Madame Ellerie’s Coif Menagerie haloing the darkness, where papa had gifted me an “unbreakable” bone comb. At nine, all stubby legged and squat, I could barely reach heads for styling. Mama had gazed on excitedly anyway, proud to have a real Ellerie piece in our salon’s collection.

Now it jangled inside my rucksack, bumping grease tins and iron clips to the tune of my façade fraying at the seams. A miserable sob shuddered free of my throat at the memory.

“Nope, none of that.” Myra loosened her hold on the reins to squeeze my arm. “Look, I get it — leaving after a fight’d chafe anyone’s ass. But you better ready yourself with whatever strength you’ve left.” Clicking her tongue, she spurred her mare into a gallop so that we’d make the last departing cloud ferry. “We’ve a melée to win, and dreams to earn. Your ma’ll come around.”

I didn’t exactly feel better, but she was right. Sucking tears from my lips, I focused on everything but memories of home: my cramped thighs clinging to our horse, Myra’s smooth staff resting against my lap, the tang of anti-inflammatory salve wafting through her furs. We rounded Han’enfol’s bordering slaughterhouses. Hours later, the breathlessness of Vanar’s hulking cloud ferries rose into view as we entered the last southern realm I’d see before taking flight.

My sense of splendor quickly disappeared after it took every stone I’d saved to board. Which came after Myra negotiated the avimage captain’s asking price down, and threw in her horse for good measure.

“Come on now, friend. Who’s trying to fly with all these dragons about?” She winked, further wrinkling his bearded glower. “Might as well cut your losses and get what you can, ‘cause these docks seem pretty damn empty tonight.”

Mama said only birds were meant to fly, so I held my breath when we pushed off, until Vanar and Han’enfol and Gyrixë and every other little underland realm disappeared below dense clouds. It was win, or beg our way back home. Abyss below, I should’ve asked Myra to do a backflip or a blade toss or something to prove she could fight. Still, she had enough bravado for us both.

“Now,” Myra said, swaggering into our modest cabin below deck. “Let’s hope you’re half as good as you claim. I still wish I’d begged Kellarin to do my hair before leaving.”

I couldn’t decide whether I admired her caution, or found it annoying.

“Kellarin?” I began unpacking my styling tools atop a rickety writing desk.

“My sister.” Myra unfurled herself across our straw bed, long limbs dangling over the side. “She does healing coiffery like your ma, which means I know my way around coif mages. I’ll know if you’re playing me false.”

Annoying, then. Definitely annoying.

“Will you now?” I tried to clear the acid from my voice. “Why didn’t you beg Kellarin, then?”

“Because…” Myra canted her head defiantly. “She took up fighting Qu’hellain’s wolf-wraiths in my stead.”

“Oh.” Iron hairclips fell through my fingers, pelting the writing desk awkwardly.

I don’t remember how old I was during Gyrixë’s last wraith massacre; I just know I’d never been more frightened than when mama clutched me close, her breath lancing hotly against my ear while villagers called for aid outside: don’t let them in, no matter what skin they’re wearing, she’d begged before going into the darkness with papa. They left me trembling in nana’s room with a torch bigger than my torso, so that I could burn wraiths out in case everyone else failed.

Now Myra’s sister would exchange bone combs for obsidian blades and magicked arrows, to help keep them at bay.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered.

“Why?” Myra challenged, rearing up onto her elbows. “Da taught ‘Rin to wield the knife too, same as any Qu’hell huntress.” Something jagged caught Myra’s tone, deflating her bravado to a paltry simmer. “And she’s in good company. She’ll travel with the last hunters Murinien trained, before she — ” Myra hesitated, eyes widening. “Nothing. Before nothing.”

Oh. Oh Gods. “Wait, don’t tell me Qu’hell’s realm dragon left, too?”

Would this kick off a second wave of the so-called dragon exodus? The first had come like a torrent, with droves of them taking flight after failed negotiations at the Empress’s imperial summit. Upland pamphleteers reported that the dragons were heading east, claiming faraway crag wilds to build army hordes; that they’d come back and burn every city if we didn’t stop them.

‘Course, that was the stupidest thing I’d ever heard. Upland realms knew nothing of dragons, or their thousand-year-long relationships with underland village families.

“Uuugh,” Myra mumbled into the bedsheets. “Me and the other hunters promised we’d keep it secret, for long as we could.” She flipped over onto her back, eyes faraway. “Muri traveled by ground during the day, so Her Arsehole Majesty’s airships wouldn’t catch her flying.”

Gyrixë wasn’t big enough to boast its own realm dragon, so with Qu’hellhain being so close … Murinen felt like my family, too. I’d often race to watch her soar overhead in the spring, scaly form carving the clouds.

“Is that why you want to become a knightess?” I asked, but Myra’s expression stiffened around a stony glare. I guess letting me in wasn’t part of the deal. “Okay, then. Let’s get to your hair.” I steered the conversation back into comfortable territory. “Now, you might know regular coif magery, but wish styling is about binding what we most desire into the tapestry of magick itself. You know about the Sight?”

Myra rose, flinging off her furs. “Sis says it’s like looking at cobwebs or something.”

“Exactly! Mage-sight exposes the raw webbings of magick that overlay our world.” Setting a chair beneath the cabin’s only window, I gathered blankets to create a makeshift styling cape. “Now, you just need to focus on your wish — think it, speak it, doesn’t matter.” I made Myra sit, and began dampening her loose coils. “The rest is my job: binding it so that magick’ll rearrange the universe to make it true.”

“Can’t possibly be that simple,” Myra sputtered. “What if I wished for the world to end? Or to raise the dead?”

I winced. Dark memories from moons prior roiled to the fore: my chubby knees pressed into the salon’s floor, as I raked magicks through my hair. I wished for papa to come back, so he could pepper us with scratchy kisses; demanded that the universe reverse time, pump blood through his heart again. I cursed Ama’ktu for delivering the news, for telling us he dropped mid-cropping.

“There are things magick just can’t do.” Breathing through the rawness aching my chest, I changed the subject. “Anyway, you got nefarious plans I don’t know about?”

“Maybe.” Myra wiggled her eyebrows. “Kidding, kidding.” Her tone shifted, turning husky. “Well, I don’t fight good when I’m worried. So … I wish for ‘Rin’s safety.”

Surprise clotted in me, stilling my hands. Myra could’ve wished for anything. Strength. Speed. Agility during the melée’s battles. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one aching for home, and I suddenly didn’t feel weak for doing so. “All right.”

Loosing a breath, I squinted ‘til the world turned fuzzy, then paused; waited until the ferry’s creaking hull faded, until I couldn’t feel the softness of Myra’s curls in my hands. Until all sense, except Sight, fled me.

My next breath rippled a gleaming sliver of webbing nearby, which brought another thread into view, and another — until the whole cabin was sketched over with fibers of magickal essence just waiting to be molded. I tapped Myra’s shoulder, signaling her to focus on her wish. When she spoke, the threads crossing her hair undulated.

I worked quickly to form medium-sized Han’enfol twists, though we stopped twice so Myra could stand and stretch, making the threads cascade down her back like strung stars. Eventually I wove the magicks through each twist, creating a corded lattice that made her hair shimmer. By the time I reached the front section, even her lashes were aglow like some woodland fae from the stories, angular cheeks and wide nose bathed in light.

But like always, my Sight exacted its toll.

Nearby magicks began writhing while I worked, tendrils undulating wildly before stabbing into my skin. As thin rivulets of blood welled up from the cylindrical wounds, I snipped the base of each by pinching them between my nails (mama taught me to never cut them low). The leftover bits eventually settle beneath your scabs, but I learned early on to work fast, which also meant hitting my favorite part sooner: gathering the magicks.

Once Myra’s twists were finished, I mouthed: to me. Churning, the threads unlatched themselves from her twists, coiling into a yarn-like ball that hovered atop my left hand.

Make it so.

They scattered, crawling across the room’s magicks with renewed purpose.

Work done, I softened my gaze; watched the webbing trickle away until feeling crept back into my hands. Sound and taste and smell flooded into me once more.

“I’m guessing this isn’t an instantaneous kinda thing?” Myra teased, stretching as she stood.

“Not exactly,” I laughed woozily; Sight work always left me drained. “Give it time.”

With the horizon still blue-black, we had hours to go before reaching Ecrouxvér. But as I cleaned up, Myra’s calloused hand caught mine.

“Thanks, Omani.”

Heat bloomed where she touched me — the same spot Mekiah, the tailor’s son, pressed a kiss to last summer. A similar feeling torched my core.

“Uh, none’s needed. I’m your retainer, right?”

Holding my gaze, Myra surprised me by tearing some of her tunic to wrap my Sight wounds. Some stung worse, having reopened previously healed scars.

“Da thinks knights are pompous and stupid.” Myra’s jaw twitched as she wound cloth about me. “He doesn’t get what it’d mean for Qu’hell to have a real knightess, even though Muri’s gone. He said if I left, it’d be as good as killing ‘Rin myself.” Her hands lingered, even though my bandages were secure. “I want to become a knightess so that I can help our people.”

We stood there with our hands clasped. Nothing to return to. Everything to lose.

“And I can do that a little easier, even with my back, knowing she might survive the week.” Myra grinned, a real smile this time, unguarded and brilliant. “Thank you for that. And for, y’know, tagging along. I haven’t, uhm … traveled like this with anyone since Muri left.”

I returned her grin, but mine was a flimsy, strained thing. Why didn’t I feel brilliant and brave and unguarded, too?

I wondered about this long after Myra climbed into bed, tired eyes watching the inky horizon out our keyhole window. Thoughts of mama came to me then; of her roasted yams and belly-splitting jokes; of the way her summer sundresses caught the light, or how she stretched onto her tippy toes to plait braids into my crown, even when her back ached from picking.

Of how I hadn’t looked back, when she watched us ride away beneath the murk.

Of how she was probably watching nanu right now, in case she woke confused or tried to wander off. Shame boiled hot in me, since we used to take turns protecting her. Who’d change places with mama now? Who’d make sure she slept and ate while nanu wasted away?

My worries bled into something with claws, rooting deep until the marrow of me felt raked through. Those worries only worsened with the sunrise. Soon, daylight flooded the horizon, revealing landmasses.

Dozens of them.

Ahead, upland realms jutted against the skyline. They loomed like gilt behemoths, cast in grandiose shades of bronze and azure, tops aglow with sprawling cities. Spiral towers needled into thin, pristine points, while bulbous temple domes reflected a patchwork of mosaic artistry. I traced granite roads bisecting the land like arteries to waterfalls spilling over the world’s edge, where their stalactite bottoms knifed into the clouds below, blotting out the underlands beneath.

The next morning, Myra woke in agony, back aflame as we skirted Ecrouxvér’s crowded port with nothing but walking sticks for balance. Jitters knotted my insides as we avoided throngs of bird-fishermen, grumbly merchers, and eager tourists — all of which only heightened the coiled tension of watching her struggle.

“At least let me help.” I rounded her other side, but Myra shooed me off.

“Stop fretting and keep up. We gotta book it! Ferry docked later than I’d hoped.”

We trudged the city’s cobblestoned streets, rounding obsidian spires where tempermages shifted winter’s chill into manufactured humidity. It might’ve been nice — if we weren’t sweating and stinking through our furs near gilt parliamentary temples, or needing to cool our damp cheeks against the Imperial History Museum’s marble colonnades.

To make matters worse, Myra’s staff kept slipping on the stones, skidding her into stagecoaches cluttering the street. She refused my help yet again, as we passed towering emporiums where Gyrixëan salt mix went for twice the banknotes they did back home, and veered from the spray of merchers beating sky-dew out of their fabric wares. We spent fifty minutes wandering, lost and sore-footed, along avenues where ruddy kids played around aqueducts plunging off the city’s edge, before finally discovering the Imperial College’s campus.

“Melée’ll be up there.” Ditching her staff, Myra pointed out a distant amphitheater that loomed between brick-topped departmental buildings and a massive belfry. “You ready?”

I could hardly see Myra past my worries, let alone respond. So, I followed as she hobbled along manicured gravel walkways, smothering an impulse to retrieve her stick while battling darker thoughts: could Myra win while in such pain? Yesterday, she was all flair and cockiness, believing our destinies within reach. Now I wasn’t so sure.

Doubt dogged the minutes we spent walking toward the theater’s entryway, and I’d barely caught my breath before an attendant spotted us.

“Competitors, both of you?” the robed usher asked. “This way.”

Sweeping inside, my stomach knotted upon seeing so many sky-folk filling the stands: wig-clad men puffing on thick cigars, little girls garbed in chainmail, peering through binoculars to spy the fighters below.

Myra elbowed me, just as we rounded the theater’s circular stage. “Look, the asshole of the hour.”

I followed Myra’s gaze. Downstage, a grave-faced woman surveyed the grounds from a painted dais, flanked by royal guard. That could only mean one thing — Empress Troxrin would preside over the melée herself.

“Does she usually call these matches?” I asked.

“Not this early,” Myra whispered. The attendant led us into a rear preparatory tent, handed Myra a placard identifying her opponent, and warned that the melée would begin in minutes. She flung herself behind a screen to change. “She’s only supposed to show up on the final day, to knight the winner.”

Gods. Which meant now, the Empress might see Myra lose early. Might narrow those beady eyes, easily forgetting the underland girls who’d given up everything to be here. Clammy and cold, I coughed around the stench of competitors dressing and smoking nearby.

“Maybe we should style your twists again, real fast.” Drawing closer to the screen, I whispered: “You could wish away your pain.”

A kind of thick, strained silence met my words, leaving me space to really hear what I’d just said. Gods! I wanted to snatch the words back with my bare hands, but my fingers felt like claws — monstrous, gnashing things that’d shorn away mama and nanu, and now Myra.

“Look, I only meant — ”

“Oh, I know exactly what you meant.” Myra came out from behind her screen, clad in dazzling armor: richly dyed leather, accented with a plackart and greaves made of interwoven iron that mimicked dragon scales. My ribcage thudded as I took her in — a real dragoness, towering and lithe, poised for flight.

“Abyss below, this was one helluva mistake,” Myra muttered. Her forehead smoothed, shifting what’d been a taut grimace into something serene. “Go home, Omani.”

Her tone was soft, yet cutting — a broadsword piercing silk. Like a final sundering of something that was once whole.

“W-what?” I stammered.

“Your services are no longer needed,” Myra replied. After fastening her knives, she turned to join the other melée competitors who’d begun lining up. “Shoulda known you weren’t strong enough to see this through.”

A million little things occurred, all at once: competitors took the marble stage to the sound of opening trumpets; I called out to Myra, but ear-splitting crowd roar swallowed the words whole. Pitching backward, I knocked into platters of wine and cheese while ushers and tailors and press pamphleteers and sky peoples frowned at the sight of tears carving my cheeks.

I’d ruined everything.

So I ran from the theater, plunging downhill as the melée’s host, Duke something-or-other, announced Myra’s opponent: “Thera the Thrasher,” a pale, tree-trunk of a woman from the underlands below Ecrouxvér who probably believed victory her birthright. The crowd’s applause faded as I scraped past manicured quadrangles and ivy-coated libraries. By the time I stopped, rucksack clanking, chest heaving, I was all sweat and snot; ashamed of myself for doubting the one person who believed in me; afraid of slinking home to mama and watching her crop until she collapsed like papa. If she’d even take me back in.

I was so absorbed, I didn’t catch the alchemist who’d stopped before me. He had a kind, round face, and carefully balanced a chemical tray full of beakers and vials against his crisp student robes.

“Got your midterms back, eh? I know that feeling,” he said, sounding upland proper. Lifting a knee, he rebalanced his samples. “Don’t worry, it gets easier after your first term.”

It felt worse being mistaken for an actual student. “I’m not — ”

“You know, why don’t you chat up your advisor?” He leaned in close enough for me to count the freckles splashing his cheeks. “They want you to think you can’t argue a grade, but you always can. What’s your department?”

Department. Like gears whirring into motion, that word planted the seeds of a plan into my addled mind. “Coif magery.”

“Well, strike that,” he laughed. “Professor Ames is known for being a hardass.”

Reeling, I remembered my offer letter; recalled the way Professor Carolyn Ames signed her name to it. “Where can I find her?”

The boy frowned. “Hasn’t Physical Magicks always been in Kent Hall, behind the clocktower?”

I left him there looking utterly perplexed, but was firmly set on my plan: find Professor Ames; impress her, regale her, do whatever I needed to win her interest. Then, plumb her for ideas about possible sponsors! Wealthy skyfolk she might know. Gods, she had to know some, right? College faculty were practically nobles, themselves.

And if I was brave enough to keep fighting in my own way, then I was strong enough to find Myra later; to apologize for everything, and pull my own weight. To rally her and trust myself — trust us both — like I should’ve all along.

I raced toward Kent Hall; pushed through the department’s heavy oak doors, wincing beneath the over-bright feel of hallways humming with electric light; poked into empty lecture halls and scanned wall signs until I found her office placard, written in the same flourished hand from my acceptance letter: Department Chair, Carolyn Ames.

Unfortunately, her door was slightly ajar, which meant my creeping steps swayed it with a nasty creak.

“Who’s there?” She called.

Her boots echoed as she whipped the door back, revealing crimson professorial robes and a stern face pockmarked with recent Sight scabs. Uniform, layered scars hid beneath them, resembling sharpened scythes.

“Professor Ames,” I croaked, throat dry. “Hi.”

Her lips pinched, as she took in my sweating, disheveled form. “Are you here for office hours?”

“Not exactly.”

Chewing my tongue, I dug through my rucksack before retrieving and extending her my offer letter. After skimming it briefly, she arched one perfectly shaped brow.

“Ah. Yes, the underlands talent. I remember your application.” She swept greying bangs from her eyes, as if to see me better. “Prospectives usually come begging to get in, but you’ve already done that.”

So why are you here? Her tone implied.

Gods, I had to choose my words carefully .  Twisting the edge of my traveling cloak between tingling fingers, I stuttered, “I came here to win patronage from the Empress.” Her narrowing eyes only worsened my stumbling speech. “I am — was working as a personal coif mage for one of her melée competitors.”

Professor Ames chuckled sharply, mouth agape. “And when that unlikely plan fails? As it already seems to have, since your coif work is a past-tense activity.”

Heat crawled my ears, dulling sound so that I had to flatten my tongue to feel the press of every syllable thudding out. “Then I’d like to discuss other options, Mistress. To prove that I’m worth investing in, to whoever’ll have me.”

Perfect brow lowering, she returned my letter; swept keen emerald eyes over me. “Meet me here tomorrow ‘round nine, before morning lecture. I promise nothing but coffee and a chat. Let’s see what you take from it, shall we?”

The door creaked shut before I could respond.

 <|startoftext|> While Dragons Claim the Sky
By Jen Brown
[Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part novelette. Please visit last week’s post to read Part 1.]

When marble cracks, it isn’t loud — or at least, not in the way I thought it’d be. Thera the Thrasher demonstrated this by cleaving her warhammer into the space where Myra’d lain moments ago. Instead of shattering, the veiny rock split with a squelch that came from sliding against itself; too dense to crumble, yet still capable of being broken.

That rockface would’ve been Myra, had she not pitched away at the last second. Clambering up, she swayed gracelessly, swiping away the blood marring her chin.

She could’ve been killed.

That thought haunted me while I watched her match from a cramped stadium seat, wedged in between two bettors who could only complain about how boring the ‘underlands scruff’ were.

“How long?” I choked out to man one on my left. “How long have they been fighting?” I’d arrived minutes ago.

“Half an hour,” he grumbled. “Abyss and shit, let’s end it already. We’re all really here to see Giralt the Grand, am I right?”

He elbowed my side just as Myra rolled from another of Thera’s crushing blows — but this time her shield split, leaving her gasping for breath and clutching her side. I shot up, fighting nausea.

Myra was losing. She might actually die here, among uncaring skyfolk, before I’d gotten a chance to —

“Finally!” screamed the woman on my right.

With a deft foot sweep, Thera pinned Myra’s weakened form with ease. Abandoning my seat, I practically vaulted the stadium stairs while the crowd roared anew. I had to get to her.

Then, everything shifted in the span of a blink. Thrusting sharply, Myra rammed her knee into Thera’s spine. Off guard from the unexpected blow, Thera wobbled right into her grip, allowing Myra to slash up against the arm pinning her throat; then low as Thera staggered backward, welling her shin red.

It was a game of quickness after that, one that ended with Myra smashing her mailed boot into Thera’s chest plate. Despite tepid applause, Myra shouted when the Empress called it, laugh-jogging to the preparatory tent as if her life hadn’t been in danger.

Though when she saw me enter, her excitement dimmed.

“There’s the non-believer,” Myra called loudly. “Convinced yet?”

My lungs were still convulsing, breaths coming hurried. “Convinced? You could’ve died!”

“It’s called a feint.” Myra rolled her eyes, though the left one had already grown puffy. “Anyway, shouldn’t you be heading toward the cloud ferries by now?”

I deserved her ire, even if it stung. “Not without apologizing.” Though washrags littered the competitor’s tent, I tore cloth from my good trousers; pressed in close to hold it against the cuts peppering her chin. “I’m so sorry, Myra. For judging you unfairly. For doubting you.”

Myra’s jaw quivered, but she didn’t back away. “Fine. Apology done. You going now?”

“No,” I shot back. “Because I’m stronger than you think, and I’m not leaving until I find my way into the coif program.”

Something gentle flitted over Myra’s features. She let me worry over her scrapes a while more before catching my wrists. “Look Omani, I was born with a shit back, but it never stopped me from skinning wolf-wraiths, tail to snout. Know why?” Her lips curled back. “Because of the herb-gatherers they stole from us beneath swollen moons; or the sick ones they maimed, just ‘cause they couldn’t lock their doors tight enough after dark. I fight because I believe in what I’m fighting for, just like Murinien taught me.” Sun-warm and kiss-soft, her fingers burned against my wrists. “So, don’t count me out again.” A small smile lit her bruised face. “And I won’t underestimate you again, either.”

It was a plea and a compact and hope bound up in one; I latched onto it with both hands.

That night, I made dragon scales of my emotions; thrust everything I had into a belief in our ability to conjure dreams. After stuffing ourselves with cured meats and rich breads in the victor’s tent, we retired to our lavishly decorated dorm room. By the time I’d fashioned her twists into a pompadour and flung her next wish into the world (this time, blessedly about easing her back pain), I practically fainted onto our only featherbed — but not before telling her about my meeting with Professor Ames.

“Well, well.” Myra sounded genuinely impressed, legs dangling off her side of the mattress. “Good on you. Make her see what they’d be missing out on.”

I yawned. “Oh, I intend to.”

We lay silent, lulled by the sound of tempermages netting Sight threads to redirect strong winds every few minutes, until Myra cleared her throat. “You know, I’ll have real money if I win this. Which I’ll send back home,” she added quickly. “But . . . if this college thing doesn’t work out, it’s money I can use for other stuff.”

Her eyes fixed mine in the darkness.

“Yeah?”

“Mm,” she returned. “You could come along while I guard Qu’hell. A real retainership, salaried and everything.”

Shivers prickled my skin as Myra’s fingers grazed mine beneath the coverlet; as we hovered atop the precipice of a sudden, surprising want; one that stretched wide, strong enough to tremble us both. Then, it morphed.

I’d come here to scrub my family’s debts away, the way papa’d always planned. Yet here I was, lying next to a fierce, unshakable girl, chasing wants my parents never could.

“We should rest,” I whispered. Painfully, I withdrew from Myra; pressed my welling eyes into the pillow, so that she wouldn’t catch me crumbling over the way dreams claimed the space in my head where family should’ve been.

Professor Ames enjoyed her Gyrixëan coffee black and scalding, dolloped with a bit of cream so that our cups matched my complexion.

“Is this a staple in your house?” she asked over-shoulder, descending Kent’s wooden stairs as if floating.

My saucer clattered melodically, punctuating our steps. “Sometimes. Mama likes to sell what’s left to the merchers, but we keep a little for special occasions.”

“And your mother taught you wish coiffery?”

Fat coffee droplets splattered my thumbs. Resisting the urge to lick them, I took the last three stairs with her, avoiding the portrait gazes of great mages lining the wall. “Yes, and no. I discovered it on accident.”

I didn’t want to mention papa; didn’t want to see pity lining her eyes. Instead, I focused on how Professor Ames liked to be on the move. We flitted between classrooms to check on student mages while walking towards her salon, then sunk onto a divan just outside once we reached its polished doors.

“One doesn’t luck into acceptances here. Tell me the truth of how you devised your wish magery.”

Guess I had no choice. You’re strong as dragonscale, I reminded myself.  She’ll be the making of you. “I tried to wish my father alive.”

“Ah.” She regarded me for a long while, wrinkled mouth puckering. “You lost him young?”

“I was twelve.” Shifting, I set my saucer aside. “It didn’t work, of course. Which made me realize that coif wishing, and all magicks really, are bound to what the universe can actually deliver.”

“Did you try other wishes?” She downed the rest of her coffee; smiled at another professor sweeping by. “Ones that might change the course of something large?”

My brow crumpled. “Well, most wishes are about the client. Things like wishing for a good harvest, or — ”

“What of wealth? Power?”

I was at a loss, unsure of myself. Had clients come to me wishing for riches and notoriety? Of course. Braylon’s boys fancied themselves Gyrixë’s best tailors; they once asked me to shear spirals into their flat-tops, wishing that one of the merchants would take their wares upland. Maybe a noble might don one of their tailored coats, exclaiming: “Who are these designers? Name them — I must have more of their work.”

They were still hustling, slogging to Han’enfol’s markets and peddling their clothing to anyone who’d listen.

“Yeah, I’ve gotten such requests, but there are no guarantees. A lot of wish magery depends on what follows, with how you dance alongside the universe as it tries to rearrange.” I could tell my answer disappointed her, so I quickly added: “Though, I’m excited to test its limits in your department. Maybe we can discuss patrons who’d find wish magery compelling?”

Professor Ames rose swiftly, so I stood too. “Patrons want to see what your gifts will buy them.” She eyed me closely. “Come. Let me show you magicks they value most.”

Entering her salon was like traipsing into a fortress, brimming with students preparing for battle. Foregoing styling chairs and capes, they huddled around large oak tables and wide bookshelves that seemed to house all the world’s knowledge. Together, we approached a group studying in the rear.

“Vincent!”

A boy with smooth, gaunt cheeks looked up. “Professor?”

“We have a prospective student all the way from Gyrixë.” He looked perplexed. “One of the underlands,” she added. “Please show her our coif specialty.”

Vincent waved over another mage, a girl with wavy hair and narrow eyes. She knelt before him as Vincent blinked, his pupils dilating enough to swallow the amber in his eyes. Summoning the Sight, Vincent raised his hands, whispered the word rise, and levitated her hair with magicks alone.

“Hold,” Professor Ames commanded, both with words and Ecrouxvérian sign language, so that her meaning reached him even without sound. Like gargoyles, they froze — Vincent stone-faced, awaiting instruction; the girl’s wide mouth slightly ajar.

“Fascinating.” Pitching forward, I tried to predict his next move. Would he completely style her hair without touching it? Make the magicks slick it into some dramatic updo?

“Raise Amelia.”

Minutely, Vincent’s fingers pinched together. Up, he commanded. Her hair went rigid, stretching around an unseen tether to lift her torso-first.

“Professor?” I sounded small.

“Hold out her arm,” Ames went on.

Grunting, Vincent pivoted his left shoulder, gritting out the word pull. Her right arm stabbed the air, sleeve felling away to reveal goose-pricked flesh where the hairs strained against her skin, as if they were being tugged. Sight scabs peppered her follicles like tics.

“Excellent,” Professor Ames cooed. Then, reverently: “Now break it.”

I turned sharply. “Professor.”

It wasn’t a question, but Carolyn knew that, preferring to keep her eyes on the way Vincent’s fingers bent. Claw-like, he squeezed the air, slithering break between his sweat-stained lips. It pulled a muffled shout from Amelia, as red colored them both — him, bloody from the Sight carving crescents atop his clavicles; her pale arm bruising where Vincent clefted muscle and tendons and bone beneath —

“Stop.” My command was cotton-soft, muted beneath the roaring in my ears.

“Well done.” Professor Ames applauded like I hadn’t spoken, then signaled two students forward. “Would you escort her to the infirmary?”

But Amelia wouldn’t go. Not without blinking rapidly into her Sight, round eyes impossibly wide. “Eat shit, Vince!”

With her good arm, she punched the air; Vincent’s chin hairs wobbled before a sickening crack sounded. Wailing, he clutched his jaw.

“Oh my.” Professor Ames laughed. “Any other volunteers? Seems they’ll both need a healer’s hand.”

I watched them stagger from the room, cold and hot all over; like my body couldn’t decide what to be.

“You see,” Professor Ames faced me, “patrons don’t fund stylists. They like charismatic diplomats. Keen politicians. Unstoppable assassins.” She pinned me with a wilting stare, crossing the distance between us. “Understand, that here? A patron funds your potential. Which means it — you — must be ruthless. That you must mold yourself into something they want to fund in the first place.”

Around us, students returned to their wrinkled scrolls and bitter coffees and weighty desks, but Professor Ames raised her Sight, hovering her fingers around a single braid along my cheek. Softly, she commanded: unravel. Magicks uncrossed the plait, expelling the added braiding hair until only my coils zig-zagged before us.

I knew what was coming. Knew it, even as my stomach bubbled wetly, last night’s dinner threatening to come up.

Align.

Her command stretched those coils until their spiral disappeared; until the hairs swung limply before my eyes. I caught it stiffly between my fingers, swallowing around a lump as it refused to spring back into place; as it blotched the picturesque view of student mages returning to a normalcy that didn’t include me.

“Now, return to the melée grounds.” Professor Ames made for the door. “And tomorrow, I — and a possible patron or two — shall be watching to see if your potential proves ruthless.”

That evening, Myra faced fiercer competition: an uplands bastard called Harric, who had plenty to prove. But this time I watched them fight with my Sight up, straining to reveal crystalline magicks sketched across the amphitheater. Blood slicked down my arms as I traced the webbing from treetops dangling overhead, to the crowded seats, to the Empress’s dais, and then down to my feet inside a quiet corner of the competitor’s tent — the most I’d ever revealed at once.

It didn’t matter that my arm was on fire, or that, if spotted, ushers could disqualify Myra for my unsanctioned use of magicks during the melée. I had to risk it, in order to understand what I’d missed after years of self-study; to discover whatever ruthless magicks Gyrixëan coif mages hadn’t known to teach me.

Edging forward, I traced the magicks Harric touched; saw them warble and twist others nearby, until I found one that seemed to run between my foot and his mailed legs. Examining it, I wondered how much force I’d need to tug the hairs lining his calves, canting his balance.

Or to break his legs, bone-by-bone —

My chest seized. I’d stopped breathing. Convulsing, I blinked and rubbed the Sight away until the sweaty heat and hard stone beneath me returned. Which meant I’d missed minute sixty-three, where Myra ended the match with a knife to his neck.

I should’ve whooped and hollered when they announced her victory, but my stomach roiled instead; Myra was a finalist now — and tomorrow, Ames would eye us both while cupping my fate between her weathered palms.

“You’ve made a believer outta me,” Myra said, swaggering into the preparatory tent. I hid my bloody arm. “Gods, my back felt great. And I haven’t been anxious about the pain coming back, like I usually am. Does wish magery quell that, too?”

I shrugged as attendants poured us celebratory wine; tipped the glass back hard enough to knock my teeth.

“Guess we’ve both cause for celebration?” Myra smirked. “Did Professor Fancybritches get you a patron on the spot?”

My chalice felt molten enough to melt flesh. Fighting an urge to dash it against the stone, I threw Myra a tight smile.

“Let’s do your hair!” I said, discarding my glass. My breathing harshened, tightening around a panic attack. One mama would’ve helped me slow, if I hadn’t left, believing the Imperial College would save us all. “Give me another wish to work with.”

The word tasted acrid and wrong; I needed to twist it. Mold it anew, so that it fit me again. As I raced back to our dorm, scraping my shins on the brambles outside, Myra was right on my heels.

“You didn’t answer my question! Was she impressed with you?”

No. “She was,” I lied. “In fact, she’ll be there to see you fight tomorrow.”

Fight. The imperial way, like Myra with her blades or Ames with her strings. Wishes did not fight; they hoped.

I pounded up our dorm’s stairwell; this time, glancing at more paintings of great mages lining the wall, and met the challenge in their stare.

“Would you gimme your wish already?” I yelled back.

Bounding up alongside me, Myra laughed, successfully deceived. “Fine. It’s a simple one this time: I wish that we get everything we want!”

After racing through our dorm’s humming hallways, we fell through our door breathlessly.

“We’re this close, ‘Mani.” Myra said, approaching the room’s lone vanity mirror. “Mm, I’m thinking . . .” She squinted, letting her twists down. “Don’t hate me for this, but take ’em all out. I want it wild and loose, so the bastards all see me coming.”

Her wish was too broad for working with, but that didn’t matter anymore. I unraveled each twist, wrapped her flowing coils in a silk square, and flung her last wish into the world even as the Sight reopened old scars along my neck — wounds that hadn’t bled since I’d tried summoning papa. Every gash felt like a betrayal, unstitching my resolve until old aches sprung free.

So, I made instruments of my agony. After Myra fell asleep, I kept my Sight up; planted myself before the vanity, and held my ashen arm before the mirror. I manipulated its long hairs without a wish to speak of; whispered commands well into the night, until it was too dark to make out my reflection. Until it was impossible to distinguish where pain ended and I began.

Our final melée came under a bruised sky as we met Empress Troxrin on the College’s wide athletic field; wavering grassland stretched on for miles, accented by the rise and fall of sloping hillsides marked with sigils denoting different magickal sports. There would be no amphitheater this evening; no roaring crowd watching from the hovering mage-stands. Just six finalists waiting, while their retinue watched from the sidelines.

Though she lacked an elevated dais, the Empress commanded authority in polished chainmail while addressing a powerful cadre: College Chancellor Vihrane, flanked by distinguished faculty like Professor Ames; magistrates from Ecrouxvér’s six provinces; sign language interpreters, in case College faculty were using their Sight — a slew of important somebodies who might as well have been nobodies to me.

“Trusted colleagues,” Troxrin intoned. “Again and again, you’ve put our Empire above yourselves, sacrificing everything to see it whole. Now, it is time I show you the gift your patience bore.”

Nerves should’ve made slush of my veins, as Troxrin began addressing Myra and her competitors. Instead, I blinked my Sight on and off like flint striking stone. Like playing my fingers over fire, ignoring the singe of it. Ready to strike, I sized up Myra’s more foolish competitors; the ones who’d clearly thought all coif mages simple healers. I took in the exposed neck hairs of one burly finalist, and the armpits of another who stretched to get limber. Somehow, I’d interject; make a key move look  like Myra’s actions, but really be mine.

“Fighters, you must be wondering what stands between you and greatness.” Myra fidgeted, hands poised on her daggers, eager to start as the Empress continued. “You will be called upon to best one another soon enough. But first, you must face the empire’s greatest danger together.”

Professor Ames clasped her hands tightly, grim mouth twitching. When she caught me staring, she inclined her head, giving me her full attention.

“This year, my champion’s bounty goes beyond banknotes and knightships.” Troxrin approached, royal guards following. “What you fight for now is the very survival of our empire, and all who walk it.”

An acrid smell drifted over us just as Troxrin raised her gauntlet, signaling something above. Distant Sight threads wavered as dark sky galleons crested the field’s western edge. Blinking out of my Sight, I squinted through the haze. Chains dangled between the airships, hauling something massive, muzzled —

“The hell?” Myra yelled.

A captured realm dragon flailed within the chains. The iridescent creature’s scales reflected sunlight in frost-blues and fuchsia-periwinkles; like a soap bubble bound against the skyline. Its muffled wailing increased as tethers gouged the fur tufting its belly, back, and snout. More rope dug into the membrane of its bat-like wings. Troxrin’s cadre rose, gape-mouthed as her warships settled it onto the field with a resounding thud.

“Comrades, competitors!” The Empress called. “I gift you one of the dragonkind that deserted us.”

Cacophony erupted: Troxrin’s senators cheered; Chancellor Vihrane hustled forward, jowls trembling. “What have you done? Empress, the old oaths. The dragonkind will come for us all!”

Professor Ames’s perfect brows arched toward the heavens; horses reared up against their handlers in fear —

“Wait, your majesty!” Myra screamed around the dragon’s muffled roars. “That — that’s Murinien.”

Murinien. The dragon who saved Qu’hellain babes from soul sucking wolf-wraiths; who taught Myra’s Da to hunt, and then Myra herself; who’d watched over Qu’hell’s plains folk for three thousand years.

“Myra.” Her name left me like a plea. I tried to make for her, but Troxrin’s guards blocked my path.

“She’s Qu’hellain’s realm dragon,” Myra pleaded. “She — ”

“Deserted her realm months ago, breaking the old oaths like all the rest of her kind,” Troxrin cut in. I stumbled backward as the Empress suddenly unsheathed a wraith-blade, made from the very creatures Myra’d kept at bay. Its icy surface matched her pallor. “Competitors, how long have you lived in fear of the dragonkind?”

I flinched against the cry of upland warriors who’d never known dragons, or the lakes they liked to drink from.

“Defeat this beast here and now,” Troxrin commanded. “And you’ll have your knightship. You’ll have my armies, too. And you’ll march on dragons littering the Eastern crag wilds before they know what’s coming!”

Finalists charged with a collective battle cry. Troxrin signaled her mages — they trained levitating arrows on Murinien’s writhing form. Myra wept openly as noble conquerors readied to annihilate her protector.

I thought of mama and papa. Of Gyrixëan summer nights, when we watched dragons circle overhead, clutching dying gryphons and ogres between their teeth, while trying to guess which realms they protected. Of the way papa kissed my frizzy curls when, at seven, I told him I wanted to be a dragon when I grew up.

You can be anything you want, he’d responded, dark cheeks puffed with a smile. You just got to believe.

Slack-jawed, I glared as Professor Ames’s tight expression broke open; felt rage boil through me as she smiled the way papa used to, whenever he saw dragons; as mage-arrows lashed through Murinen’s wings from above, and competitors slashed at her belly below.

Reaching into myself, I discovered a smoking pit dense enough to swallow the sky. I recalled my Sight in one blink, revealing milky threads that stretched from Troxrin’s feet to the galleons above, running right through her guards before me.

And then, ruthlessly, I spat a single word while my hands hovered over magicks kissing their mailed legs: move.

In one motion, they buckled unnaturally, falling away. I strode over them like dust mites, keeping my left hand firmly on the magicks pinning them. No one noticed me yet — not the competitors hacking at Murinien; not Troxrin. Not even Myra, who still wept into her hands.

So, next came the galleons. I searched their hull quickly, hungrily for — aha! A shorthaired avimage stood at the bow, forehead bleeding as she manipulated threads about her craft like a cradle. I didn’t need to bring the whole ship down; I just needed to get its captain.

Raising blood-slicked fingers, I reached for the magicks stretching from her hair to my hands, yelling: throw.

This time, the threads pulled at me, almost upending my legs. But I stood my ground as they lifted the avimage jaggedly, then flung her overboard. The leftmost galleon tottered in midair, tossing its soldiers in every direction.

Troxrin spun, mouthing something I couldn’t catch, wraith-blade aloft.  I hunted for the right galleon’s captain, but the pinned guards quickly named me her adversary. Sighting me, Troxrin advanced, auxiliary guards falling into line as I scrambled backward, searching for an advantage against the incoming mob.

But someone’s blade struck out, cutting the air between Troxrin and me. My heart lurched as Myra wedged herself between us, knives spinning for the Empress’s head. Troxrin snarled, quickly shifting between smoky silhouette and solid form to avoid Myra’s blow. Her wraith blade pulsed with the effort, lending her its power. Troxrin thrust its full might toward Myra’s torso.

We wouldn’t last like this, with the world bearing down on us.

Casting around, I searched for another move — but the magicks in my left hand suddenly severed, shearing painfully from my flesh as my fingers bent. I came out of my Sight with a scream.

Professor Ames bore down on me, hands curled like talons, tight-lipped snarl frozen in place.

“So, you would turn your ruthlessness against the empire?”

Though chaos raged everywhere, I smiled. Finally, I understood my place. “No. I’m shaping it into something my parents would be proud of.”

Summoning strength that mama and papa and nanu helped me tend, I called back my Sight even as Professor Ames fought for control of my body; as Myra failed to hit Troxrin, whose wraith-blade made landing blows impossible.

I peered past all of it, out to the magicks surrounding Murinien’s chains and muzzle; counted every thread touching her fur in my mind’s eye.

Break.

I thought it, spoke it, flung it into the sky — until the threads around Murinien’s chains shattered, taking the iron with them, pushing air and matter and debris around so that her muzzle and shackles disintegrated. Aghast, Professor Ames staggered as the world behind her seared, bubbled, erupted. I squeezed my eyes shut as Myra launched into me, hurtling us aside. Murinien’s flames licked past, igniting everyone but us.

And when the light flaring behind my eyelids faded, I opened my eyes; blinked my Sight away, taking in the destruction.

Only Myra and I remained, sweaty and ash-soaked, amid the now-charred ruins.

“How  —  how?” Myra stumbled ahead. We faced Murinien, whose pale eyes raked over us. “Your coif magery did all this?”

I shuddered. “No. That was the College’s coiffery, at its finest.” My heart stopped, as realization dawned on me. “Troxrin?”

“Not dead,” Myra muttered, dusting off her armor. “Stupid wraith blade saved her ass, yet again.”

But those without such abilities were gone. Professor Ames. Magistrates and senators. Even the competitors, who’d been too busy hacking at Murinien to notice us. I swallowed.

“You okay?” Myra asked.

Murinien approached while I struggled to answer, claws crunching over the smoking field. Myra practically leapt into her belly, nuzzling tightly against her fur. Murinien brought her head low; the best hug a dragon could manage.

Thank you for saving me. Murinien’s voice rang in my head, loud and clear as bell chime.

I staggered back a little. “Y-you’re welcome.”

Myra laughed. “You’re always so formal, Muri.” Which meant Myra’d heard her, too.

Murinien exhaled a bit of smoke. And you are always so teasing.

“But you love me anyway.” Myra put out her hand, beckoning me. And even though we stood amidst a field of ash, I took it, letting her warmth soothe my aching fingers. “Muri, my friend here doesn’t just do fancy, life-saving magicks. She grants wishes.” Myra pushed my hands into Muri’s soft belly fur. “She might grant yours, if you ask it of her.”

I felt a part of me stir; the part that loved papa and mama, and the underland magicks I grew up with. “You have a wish?” I asked.

Murinien paused. I have many. She rose up then, turning from us a little. But I abandoned Qu’hell against the empire’s orders. Left to join my kin who yearned for quiet, for freedom after eons of service. I knew the cost of this. Knew the humans I’d leave behind. So, kind as your offer is, I cannot accept.

Myra scoffed, voice shaking. “Don’t you dare start that, Muri. Look, you made us strong. You made me strong. And now, we have to carry on those lessons you and the other dragonkind taught. I’d rather see you free, old oaths be damned.”

Muri rumbled, sounding like a purring cat stretching beneath the sun, but she said no more.

“I . . . didn’t grow up with a realm dragon,” I began, stroking her fur gently. “But I watched them fly overhead. Heard of the wars we took you into, the problems we made you solve.” I smiled, remembering papa. “But you gave my family something to dream about. And you knocked our crops free just by flying over, even though you weren’t meaning to.”

Muri laughed in my mind, the sound coming like waves breaking against a moonlit cliff. Who said we weren’t trying to do just that?

“Then you were always thinking of us,” I grinned. “Now, it’s time to think of yourselves. So, I’ll ask again — you have a wish, yes?”

Far off, Ecrouvér’s emergency sirens wailed. Soon, Troxrin would bring her armies; would scour uplands and underlands alike for those who stole her victory.

Myra squeezed my hand, as if sensing my thoughts. Well, mama had always told me: pick your battles one at a time, and I wouldn’t shirk her teachings now. Until Myra and I somehow made our way back to family, I’d wrap myself in her sayings until I forgot them, like nanu.

Murinien rumbled. Very well. But may I wish for more than one thing?

“Yeah,” I said. “I’ll send out whatever I can.”

I wish to remain free alongside my kin, until the sun calls me home. And I wish for your safety — that this empire never finds you or your families again.

There were no guarantees, but if there could be such things as dragons and underland girls who found their power above the clouds, I thought anything might be possible.

“Once more, Muri?” I asked.

I called back my Sight. Murinien roared, and the magicks crossing her fur illuminated brilliantly, shimmering up and over her horns to set the sky ablaze.

See it done.

Closing my eyes, I wove her wish into the world’s fabric. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> My Country is a Ghost
By Eugenia Triantafyllou
When Niovi tried to smuggle her mother’s ghost into the new country, she found herself being passed from one security officer to another, detailing her mother’s place and date of death over and over again.

“Are you carrying a ghost with you, ma’am?” asked the woman in the security vest. Her nametag read Stella. Her lips were pressed in a tight line as she pointed at the ghost during the screening, tucked inside a necklace. She took away Niovi’s necklace and left only her phone.

“If she didn’t die here, I am afraid she cannot follow you,” the woman said. Her voice was even, a sign she had done this many times before. Niovi resented the woman at that moment. She still had a ghost waiting for her to come home, comforting her when she felt sad, giving advice when needed. But she was still taking Niovi’s ghost away.

Stella paused. She gave Niovi a moment to think, to decide. She could turn around and go back to her home taking the necklace with her. Back to her unemployment benefits and a future she could no longer bring herself to imagine, or she could move down the long stretch of aisles, past the dimming lights and into the night, alone, her mother’s ghost left behind—where do ghosts return to in times like this? Niovi would be a new person in a new country, wiped clean of her past.

Foreign ghosts were considered unnecessary. The only things they had to offer were stories and memories.

Niovi had prepared herself for this, and yet she had hoped she wouldn’t have to leave her mother behind.

She gave the necklace to the impassive woman and let herself drift down the aisle as if a forceful gust of air ushered her away.

Her mother’s ghost waved goodbye behind the detector and Niovi’s thoughts was of the Saturday of Souls. It was a prayer, an invocation as she put more and more distance between her and the security woman, her and the necklace. Without her mother’s ghost she would start to forget soon. But this she had to remember. She needed to hang on to something now that her mother had been pried from her hands.

The Saturday of Souls.

When the ghost finally disappeared, Niovi’s legs felt like lead. Her arms felt like lead. Everything felt like lead and she could barely move.

“Welcome!” Niovi heard the driver say as she boarded the airport shuttle.

The first thing Niovi faced when she stepped out of the shuttle was the cold. It was only October. Snow would start at the end of November. But even now the cold was so utter, so complete, it seemed like a wall, an extra line of defense between herself and these people who had too many ghosts and her who had none. A final warning that foreign ghosts were a nuisance, a waste of space.

“Don’t worry,” she whispered to the frost. “You are too late.”

She started her new life in a small apartment in a badly-lit part of a street that led to a cul-de-sac.

In the mornings, as she waited for the days to pass so she could start her new job, she would walk around the city, counting ghosts.

Every time she went out the people of the city would notice her, look at her, and scrutinize her. No, not her. The absence of her ghost. She was an oddity among people cloaked in spirits that followed their every step. Some of them looked at her with concern and others with outright curiosity.

There were others without ghosts, of course. They were usually huddled together in small groups, shielding themselves against the unwelcome stares or, perhaps, against their own loss. Niovi couldn’t bring herself to even glance at them. Instead she gravitated towards the other ones. The ones who still had ghosts. Despite their looks of curiosity and sometimes pity. Most of them didn’t even notice their presence, the ghosts’ affections were natural, ordinary. Niovi found this nonchalance fascinating.

Then, there were the untethered ghosts. The ones conjured by the collective memory of the people. They did not belong to anyone in particular. They belonged to everyone. Niovi liked to think they belonged to her too, especially here.

There was the ghost of the old general. He stood right next to his own statue along with the ghost of his horse and offered a spectacle for the little kids. A stubborn man, as Niovi found out; he had been trotting the same square for two hundred years. He had died in a battle that few remembered. He stood there with his medals of honor, speaking in an antiquated manner that nobody understood and riding his ghost horse, saluting the tourists.

Niovi liked the General. He was old, really old and came from a time when ghosts could move around following their loved ones without borders tearing one from the other. Niovi thought of the necklace she tried to bring her mother in. They had sent it to her a few days later, cold, empty. She kept it anyway. It was her mother’s after all.

She sat on a bench, a bag of chips in her lap, and let her mind wander back home. To her empty house. Her mother’s house. Did her mother’s ghost stay there or had she moved on? Maybe she had followed someone else in the family like she did when she was alive and Niovi ignored her calls. Become their ghost.

The edges of her mother’s face were already beginning to blur in her mind. They became fuzzy. She looked at her mother’s pictures on her phone but they were lifeless and flat. They did little to bring her mother’s image back.

So she sat at the square looking at the children scream in a language she was still learning and heard them laugh and laugh.

Niovi’s first job was at a Greek restaurant next to the Southern Harbor. She wanted to cook. In fact, she needed it. Not just so she could justify her staying in the country. Cooking was what her mother had done best when she was alive, and when they were still together in Athens, daughter and ghost, cooking could help her not forget the things she desperately needed to hold on to.

The sullen ghostless man at the restaurant inspected Niovi’s resume and asked her a series of questions, dubious that she could do what she claimed. He told her that many people claimed to do things they couldn’t just to get a job here, but Niovi wasn’t sure that was true at all. Maybe they could do those things but, if they were ghostless like her, and like her sullen to-be-boss, at some point they had started to forget the details. Niovi tried to drown a small voice whispering that she might be next.

“All right,” the man said in the end. “You’ll start with the dishes and you’ll move up to prep.”

Her heart dropped at that, but it was a door—or perhaps a half-open window—to the job she wanted, so she agreed to work the morning shifts.

Niovi conjured her mother’s image stirring a pot of stewed okra, the ghost of her mother’s aunt whispering something to her as she cooked. She conjured the smells of spices and the tomato and the sweat gathering on her mother’s brow like this could bring her ghost back. Or at least help her keep those precious details.

She found herself in that scene too. At the table her young self looked down at her plate and scrunched her face in disgust. Her father nodded in a conspiratorial way from the other side of the table, much to his own ghost’s disapproval. He made up a chore to excuse her from the table. Her grandmother—her father’s ghost—shook her head but said nothing. Niovi slid from her chair and ran outside, because back then she hated okra. How stupid.

In the end she was not sure this helped at all. Instead what she found when her break was over and she was back in her post was a whiff of similar scents drifting from the restaurant’s kitchen wrapped in a blanket of hot air. It wasn’t okra they were cooking. But the spices, the slow murmuring of pots, the noises, were all achingly intimate.

She couldn’t help but leave the water running and follow the scent to the kitchen. She expected familiar scents here but not that familiar.

There was a man hunched over bigger and smaller pots. His moves calculated in a quiet choreography as he assembled the dishes. Locks of ashen blond hair peered from under his head wrap. Niovi knew that the staff was mostly made up by non-Greeks but still, this man’s ghost caught her off guard. Not because he had a ghost to begin with. Almost all the waiters she had met had one; this was their country after all. But this ghost was everything he wasn’t and everything familiar to her.

It was the ghost of an old woman, older than her mother was when she died. Her hair was dark with grey streaks, curly and unruly, and her face at odds with the cook’s. She hovered over him and when his hands twitched or when his breath quickened she would rest a hand on his shoulder and he would calm down again, his moves becoming more precise and deliberate. When he would finish assembling a dish the ghost would smile and nod. His back was turned away from the ghost but Niovi knew he felt her approval.

“Niovi!” Her boss’s voice came from the back. And just like the man looked up, and so did the ghost that reminded her so much of her mother, and the Saturday of Souls snapped back in her mind like a wound that had just reopened.

Before the man, who had a smile that took up half his face, had a chance to utter a word, she realized she had been standing there for far too long. So she gave him a faint nod and left to finish her shift, turning her head on him a little too fast, desperate to hide her tears.

Niovi asked about him the very next day. She talked to Matilda who always spoke slowly enough for her to understand, but her attention drifted as soon as Niovi had a hard time finishing a sentence. Or perhaps without a ghost Matilda had nowhere to rest her eyes on. Perhaps this absence made her uneasy.

The cook’s name was Remi and he was born here, though his maternal grandparents came from Greece some fifty years ago. They died here too, never having a chance to really retire. That’s why he could still have his grandmother’s ghost, who seemed to fit in this place as much as Niovi did, which was not very much.

Niovi felt the stabbing of jealousy. Remi could have it all. He could speak like a native and have a ghost which carried the kind of knowledge Niovi had to fight to keep with her. As soon as she thought this she felt ashamed.

“You know,” Matilda said. The ghost of a young man stood always by her side. From the similarities Niovi could guess it was a close family member. A brother maybe. Matilda seemed at ease with it and didn’t even give it a second glance. Niovi looked Matilda in the eyes to avoid looking at the ghost. “You could come with us one night out. Just some people from work. Talking more to us would help you practice.”

“What about Remi?” Niovi dared to ask.

Matilda smirked a little, which made Niovi’s face flush. But before Niovi had the chance to say anything Matilda gave her a half-shrug. “He prefers to hang out with the ghostless. That’s not going to help you integrate.”

All Niovi could hear behind the concern was, our ghosts are enough. We are enough. But their ghosts were too different and living people were harder to be around. She had spent so much time with her mother’s ghost, her quiet sighs and her calm stare engulfing her every move, that when she was asked to join her coworkers after a shift she would always decline.

“Too tired,” she said, because she did not want to say too sad.

In this city, like in any other, Niovi would find ghosts everywhere. They peered out from behind curtained windows, waved at her from old swing sets, or stood in grocery store aisles staring thoughtfully at a shelf that wasn’t there anymore. But most of all—if they were the tethered kind—they were discreetly following their person.

Ghosts were made of stories. It was the way they chose to tell them that was different. In this country ghosts seemed more like shadows to her. They were calm, less opinionated. Their stories were made of stares and slight nods, sometimes a pat on the back.

In Greece the ghosts were louder, their disapproval mattered, their whispers were sought out and their stories carried memories her people would not have remembered otherwise. Not in the same vividness of smells, tastes and textures. Sometimes, when listening to one of her mother’s stories, Niovi could catch herself reliving an event that never happened to her. Something that had happened to her mother or her grandmother decades ago carried the feeling and the weight of the present. It made her happy, sad or angry, in what here would be considered a disproportionate amount.

Despite her efforts to conjure the memories, she couldn’t do it in quite the same way. She was beginning to forget. It started with the holidays, then the right words took longer to reach her lips and later the proper way her family spiced the dishes.

When her mother’s swift hands stuffed the cheese filling in the pie on Sundays before the sun had risen, was it mint or basil she used? When she cooked the tender beef in casserole with fresh tomatoes, was it cinnamon that made its flesh so sweet and aromatic or was it allspice?

Even as a ghost her mother never failed to remind her of those things, of who she was and why she was, especially when she felt sad and lonely. Her mother was really good at picking up on that. Without her mother or her ghost around, she was losing parts of herself she did not know how to get back.

None of the ghosts she met here spoke her tongue or at all. She knew there must have been people like her who died in this country. As much as this thought made her stomach churn, she knew this might happen to her in the future. But up until now she thought they had chosen to return home rather than stay here. Follow their roots back to where they came from and haunt a relative or simply move on.

But then she saw Remi’s grandmother and nothing was quite the same after that.

It was a strange day at work.

Her ever-surly boss told her that she would be moving up to preparations next week. Her stomach twisted into a bundle of fear and nerves.

“You’ve made it.” Remi patted her on the back, smiling. His ghost ever so slightly touched the boundaries of her perception, made her recoil.

She whispered a thank you and swallowed. The world was closing in around her.

Niovi’s new place would be next to Remi in the kitchen. Seeing him—seeing his grandmother’s ghost too—for as long as she worked here. Asking for another shift would be too soon, quitting would be unthinkable. She had nowhere to go.

She started drifting in and out of a past she could barely piece together. The Saturday of Souls was just around the corner and she had spent the previous nights talking with relatives on the phone, trying desperately to recreate her memories vicariously. Longing for that connection to her mother again.

What ingredients did her mother use for the offering of koliva? What were the words she would say in her prayers? Niovi tried to invoke the particulars that made her mother’s ritual unique. Not the ones she could ask other people about, the ones she could read about, but the ones she could once taste and hear in her mother’s distinct voice. A one-person culture among her people’s collective one.

She could not. Yet her family offered to help.

“There are nine ingredients in koliva. How could you forget?”

“When will you visit us?”

“Light a candle for her soul.”

“Is there a Church to take the offering? Where will you go?”

Where would she go?

Where did the ghostless people go? The ones she met on the street always looked lost to her, directionless, the way they squeezed against each other. But maybe it was just what she felt, a projection of her own aimlessness.

She finally gave in.

It wasn’t so much the pressure of her coworkers that did the trick as much as Remi and his ghost. It hurt to linger in the kitchen when Remi was working. When they had to exchange to talk during their shift (which was not very often) she felt the stare of the woman following.

So one day, after her shift, she let herself be carried away by the people with the ghosts that did not hurt her, whose stares she could not read as easily. The ghosts who could teach her a few things about this place to replace the ones she had forgotten.

She let the crowd of five talk over her, through her, as if she were one of their ghosts. Once in a while she would offer a half-formed sentence or she would ask a question that seemed too fundamental to them, but completely vital for her understanding of their discussions. They spoke too fast for her to follow anyway.

After a while she gave up, or maybe they did.

She got up to leave, more lost than ever. As if she were the anchor, the reason all this was happening—she wasn’t—the others cut their conversations short and paid the bill in haste.

They all walked, half-drunken and languid, down the stone-paved street. The pubs, arranged on either side, were luring the people inside, away from the biting wind, but the street musicians had other plans. The restaurant where Niovi worked was right around the corner, on one of the busiest streets.

It was Matilda who told her then about the ghost of a street musician, a couple blocks down. She was untethered like the General and only appeared on Sunday nights at the same place she performed when she was still alive, strumming her ghost guitar.

“What kinds of songs does she sing?”

“Oh, the same sad songs. Some of them foreign.” Matilda rested an arm over Niovi’s shoulder to fix the strap of her slingback shoe. Niovi tolerated the jab of the woman’s elbow against the hollow of her neck. She wanted to be accommodating. “She’s really popular with the couples.”

Niovi nodded. She imagined what song her mother would sing if she were here. Probably none. She would make the pots clutter and shuffle around the table in a harmonious frenzy. That was her mother’s music.

They were getting closer to the spot where the ghost of the singer performed. Withered flower petals carpeted the concrete slabs.

When she heard the music she instantly knew the song was Greek. The ghost was a woman in her fifties, the hippie type, with kind eyes. She strummed the guitar while playing a tune on a harmonica set on a neck rack. She didn’t look Greek from afar, but Niovi had been fooled before.

As if he manifested from her most hidden thoughts, the ones she was trying to keep silent with a night like this one, Remi stood there, a few feet away from the ghost of the musician but fully enveloped in his own.

It felt like too much and like nothing at all. Like one of those moments where a decision must be made. Niovi looked behind her. The company of five had stopped in front of another street musician, a living one, or perhaps a pub—she couldn’t say for sure—debating something Niovi was too tired to decipher.

So instead Niovi took her place besides Remi who was mouthing the words of the song, absent-minded. His grandmother’s ghost—her curly hair worn in an old-fashioned updo—radiated calmness. Niovi felt her body permeating the outline of her, the warmth of familiarity against her skin sharper than the coldest of days here.

She did not move an inch, just stood very still listening to the song, feeling a sweet misplacement.

“How does she know the words?” Niovi was convinced now the musician’s ghost was a local. The words came out without the depth and the nuance they were supposed to. But they did come with an emotion Niovi admired.

Remi turned around immediately as if a current of electricity had run through him. His grandmother’s lips curled into a smile.

“From her husband,” he answered, still stunned by her boldness, perhaps, her change of attitude. “He came here in the late 80’s. She was the first person he talked to in this country when he walked down this street, wide-eyed and lonely.”

Much like you, Niovi imagined him saying the words, but she was certain they were there.

Niovi’s body shivered as she took a few more steps towards him. Towards his ghost that had haunted her in the most complete sense.

“You know,” he said after he had reclaimed some of his composure. “We are not alone here. There are parts of us everywhere you look. We have a past here too.”

You have a past, she did not say to him. He must have known he was different already. Instead a small hope flickered into existence. A promise remembered.

“Do you celebrate the Saturday of Souls here then?”

He smiled a faint smile. In his eyes there was openness and she was ready to listen.

He showed her a small engraved handkerchief. This was how he carried his grandmother.

Something loosened inside of her.

He had no other family, no siblings—unlike her—and no parents. The ghost was of his grandmother who had raised him since he was ten. When she died she stayed with him.

“I came back home from the funeral,” he said. “And there she was, standing over her handkerchief, waiting for me.” He took a small sip from his coffee, his voice unsteady like his hand.

The ghost’s eyes were compassionate as she stroked her grandson’s head.

“She is the only connection I have with the past. My past.” He smiled. His smile had a bitter tint. Niovi understood more than he let on. She blinked back tears, for him, for her, for envying him all this time, for not reaching out to him earlier.

If her longing for her mother was a string, that string had somehow grown into a rope within days, hours. Ever since Remi had told her he would help her see her ghost again. There was a reason ghostless people huddled together. To share memories and stories and pool their resources. There were even untethered ghosts formed by the memories of big enough families. There was a way to bring her mother’s ghost into this country. If even for a little while.

“You cannot do this alone,” he said. “But you can do it.” There was a promise in his words and for the first time since she came here she believed it.

On Saturday she met Remi. He took her to a place in the city she had never been before, but she had not been to most places anyway. They walked around, shoulder bumping against shoulder. His grandmother’s ghost followed them timidly.

In those streets almost no one looked at her—at the emptiness above and around her—with sorrow or alarm. Even the locals strolling the alleyways with their ghosts did not give her a second glance. The ghostless people met her eyes unfazed. Many of them walked in groups but now her perception had shifted. Now she saw the enjoyment as well as the need to share stories, jokes, company. To give as well as take.

The ghostless held candles and plates of koliva and offerings for the dead. There was excitement in the air. It was a celebration.

“This is how ghosts are conjured here,” Remi told her. “It doesn’t have to be sad.”

No, it didn’t.

She was daunted and restless about this newfound freedom. The ease of knowing that the person she came from—because people came from people more than they came from places—could be revisited like a place could. Back in Greece she had never had to think of lineage before. She had taken her mother’s ghost for granted and she realized now that this was a privilege.

If her longing for her mother was a rope, that rope had branched out to Remi, to his grandmother’s ghost, to the ghostless people around her. Niovi let the rope guide her. She followed the crowd rushing inside the red bricked, corner building, wedged between offices downtown.

Whispers and laughter hang in the air when she came in. Niovi took a careful look around for familiar ghosts, her breath caught in her chest. Her anticipation deflated a sliver, when she found nothing had changed. She scolded herself for hoping too much when Remi guided her to the far side of the wall.

There was a long table there, covered in white embroidered tablecloths. Plates of all shapes, sizes and colors were left on the linen but held only one thing: koliva, food for the dead.

She left her own plate there. Niovi had made them herself, taking extra care to not forget any ingredient, afraid that if she did, then all this, all the strength she had gathered inside of her during the days leading up to Saturday, all would be for nothing.

Niovi lit a candle, steadied it inside the heap of koliva, and left the necklace on the table. Remi stood right there next to her, his shoulder brushing hers. She took a deep breath and took in the smell of each of the ingredients. Nine like the ranks of Angels:

Wheat, for the Earth and the souls of those who lie buried under.

Bread crumbs, for the dirt–may it be light upon their grave.

White, candied almonds, for the blanched bones of the dead.

Pomegranate seeds, for Persephone and Hades, but also the promise of Heaven.

Cinnamon, for all the smells and tastes of this world.

Parsley, for the green, green grass of the resting place.

Raisins, for the vines of Dionysus and the sweetness that is this life.

Sugar, for the sweetness of the Afterlife.

Nuts and seeds, for fertility and life that laughs in the face of death.

There was a change in the atmosphere, a mixing of scents. Niovi heard Remi draw in air and opened her eyes. For a few moments she stared at the necklace on the table. She didn’t dare look up.

When she did look up her mother’s ghost was not as she remembered. The ghost was made of memories that all lit up at once like a beacon inside her, her voice was a mixture of spices and familiar tastes. It all descended on her, draping her like a veil.

She saw her mother’s eyes for the briefest of moments. And then what there was of her mother’s ghost scattered all around her and soaked this new country so she could finally call it her own. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Wytchen Wood
by Lori J. Torone
A decade of shavings covered the floor of Lewys’s carpentry shop. He didn’t bother sweeping any more, although he probably should — wood without magic produces a drab dust that desiccates the throat, shrivels the lungs. He coughed and gulped from his flask, stepping back from his work. Carving the finishing scrollwork on yet another hope chest for the latest bride-to-be in town did nothing to fill his own hollowness.

“Wait for me,” she had whispered in the wytchen grove so many years ago, her berry-scented breath caressing his cheek, “I will come back to you.” She’d taken magic with her, in the wytchen dust glinting in her sunlit hair as she waved goodbye from the newly-carved wagon. She took his heart as well, but left hope in its place.

Over the years, hope had drained into loneliness, empty and aching, present in the sound of his saw’s jagged edge, the taste of his own cough-strained, stale breath, the starkness of his bedroom above the shop. No chance of a bride now, for him, in this small town where he had spurned all coy glances sent his way, waiting for his true love to return.

He wished he hadn’t waited.

Still coughing, Lewys threw open the window shutters. He gulped fresh air. Delighted cries of children entered with the breeze.

A pageant wagon creaked into the town square outside his shop, horseless, shedding curls of magic onto the cobblestones from its warped wytchen beams. Children dropped coins into a box attached to the wagon’s carriage and scrambled for seats. Eyes widening in shock, Lewys unconsciously dug his fingernails into the windowsill. The wagon’s wood was peeling, its stage floor crooked, but it was still the same one. The only one.

As the threadbare curtain opened, more wood peels and sparkling dust showered the stage from the covered wagon’s rafters, a natural emission of the enchanted wood, once cut and carved. A princess puppet slumped against a painted forest backdrop. She wore a gown the deep blush of sunset, the falling wytchen dust creating a net of crystals in her golden hair. With the clack of wooden joints, she began a light, graceful dance. A troll, lumbering in from stage right, tore a gasp from the children.

Lewys saw what the audience did not know to look for: The shadow of the puppet master’s hands weaving along the stage floor. These puppets had no strings. The wytchen wood itself conjured the play, the magic within the wagon and the carved puppets animating them, their movements directed from above by the puppet master’s hands.

After the princess outsmarted the troll, she befriended a dragon, its velvet tongue unfurling like a panting dog. Adults and children alike cheered when she saved a village from a witch.

The curtain closed; the crowd dispersed.

Lewys grabbed his jerkin and dashed outside.

The wagon’s damage looked even worse up close. Red rope secured the corners, but it was a temporary bandage for the cracked joints which exposed the wood’s inner pith.

The old puppet master emerged from behind the curtain. “Master Lewys, look how well your craft weathered the years. Although, I must admit, some repairs are needed.”

“Master Rhodri, you take me for my father,” Lewys replied. “He is gone these last ten years. I have his carpentry business as well as his name now.”

Hobbling towards him on gnarled joints as the stage boards shifted and groaned, the old man squinted at Lewys. “Aye, I remember you,” Rhodri said, beckoning the carpenter to follow him into the narrow living space behind the stage backdrop.

“Is your daughter here?” His lips were dry; his heart constricted with a bare remembrance of hope.

A slow smile deepened the lines on the old man’s face. “You remember Roselyn?”

The first time Lewys had seen Roselyn, she was sitting on a stump in the wytchen grove, her hair a curtain over her face and lap. He was passing through on his way further into the forest, hatchet slung over his shoulder. “My lady?” he said, approaching carefully, as he would a hare in a thicket, “Are you well?”

She looked up then, and instead of a face smudged with tears as he expected, he saw one smudged with ink from the parchment and quill in her hands. Her eyes were startled, as blue as an open sky. The sun blinked through the branches and transformed her hair into spun gold.

Lewys caught his breath.

“Indeed, I am very well,” she replied. “Do you like stories?”

“What? Uh . . . yes. Doesn’t everyone?” he stammered.

“Good!” She jumped off the stump and pocketed an inkwell that had been lying in the grass. “This one is finished. You can be our practice audience.” She grabbed Lewys by the wrist and he let go of his hatchet in surprise, dropping it behind him. He spluttered a weak protest — he was supposed to meet his father for work — but the girl tugged him away, into the stand of birch trees that bordered the road into town.

“Audience for what? You don’t even know me!”

“Of course I do. Father!” She shouted as they came upon an old wagon pulled into the grass on the side of the road. “The carpenter’s son has agreed to see the new play!”

Lewys recognized the man sitting in the grass in front of a small fire, stirring the contents of a pot hanging from a tripod. He was an itinerant toymaker; every girl in the village had at least one of his wood and cloth dolls. Lewys himself had a painted jester on a stand, cleverly rigged to somersault when a button was pressed. It was still on a shelf above his bed, even though he was too old to play with it now.

Master Rhodri looked from his daughter to Lewys and back again. “Roselyn, are you sure . . . ”

She pulled her father to his feet and thrust the parchment into his hands. “Look, I finished! It’s the perfect story for the new puppets! Oh, be careful, it’s still wet.”

“All right, then,” Rhodri said, pulling a handkerchief out of his vest pocket to wipe his fingers, “but only if the young man does not mind.”

Lewys did not. Roselyn showed him where to sit in the grass beneath a tree, the gentle push of her hand through his shirt sending thrills along his skin. She was a flurry of activity, her bright hair and patched dress swinging to and fro as she fetched the puppets and whispered to her father as he studied the parchment. The puppets were exquisitely carved, like all the dolls Rhodri made, but these had moveable joints and strings, each attached to a cross of wood. Their hair was tangled yarn and their clothes multi-colored swatches of fabric.

Roselyn and her father climbed into the wagon and lowered the puppets into the grass below. The wooden figures clacked as they began to move, and within minutes Lewys forgot about the strings connected to the pair in the wagon above, their hands moving the crosses gracefully. A curtain lifted in his mind.

The story unfolded, wordless but spoken through the puppets’ movements. Within Lewys’s eyes, the wagon turned to mountain ranges, the grass to a river ford, so real that he could feel the cold wind in the high cliffs and hear the rush of the river. He was immersed in the hardships the brothers faced as they searched for each other. His heart leapt at their final happy reunion. When the puppets bowed, the story’s spell over Lewys’s mind broke, and he returned with a jolt to his seat in the grass, cooled by the shade of the tree. Roselyn’s pleased face smiled down at him from the wagon. He broke into spontaneous applause.

“That was well done,” a voice called from further back in the trees. Lewys turned and sprang to his feet. His father approached with his two apprentices. “No wonder my son has shirked his duty for the day.” He held out the hatchet. Lewys took it as his father said more quietly, “I was afraid something happened to you, lad.” Lewys’s face reddened.

“It’s my fault,” Roselyn said, as she gathered the puppets up. “I did not give him much choice. Please do not be angry with him.”

Rhodri came down from the wagon. The carpenter shook his hand, then looked up at the girl, his eyes squinting against the high sun. “Well,” the Master Carpenter said, then turned sharply to Lewys, whose color deepened to scarlet.  “I can see the appeal of such a play.” The apprentices, a few years older than Lewys, grinned and elbowed each other.

“The puppets,” he turned back to the toymaker, “are they a new crafting?”

“Yes. My first two. My daughter has great plans for me to make others. She wants a dragon and a witch in particular. And a girl puppet, of course.”

The elder Lewys rubbed his chin, dark with beard. “There was something about that play, something quite powerful. I forgot where I was for a while. And I realize that I am long overdue for letters to my own siblings.”

“My daughter wrote the story,” Rhodri said proudly. “First I had the puppets in mind as another toy, but it was Roselyn’s idea to perform plays with them. Do you truly think others will enjoy such entertainment?”

“Truly, but you need a proper stage — a pageant wagon, perhaps, so you can still travel as you do.” The carpenter hesitated, glancing at his apprentices, then looked up at Roselyn again. He seemed to make up his mind, and continued, “There is a special wood that I use only for certain projects. I would like to build a pageant wagon for you with this wood. I never take payment for wytchen,” he added quickly, when Rhodri blanched. “As I said, it is only for special creations. And I believe this project, and your work, is worthy of it.”

Lewys looked at his father in shock. He vaguely remembered the wizened man, passing through town, who had shown his father how to cut wood from the strange trees that no axe could fell before, how to craft an object — for him, it was a staff — with tools and words.

His father had used the wytchen only one other time, as far as Lewys knew, to build a cradle for their neighbor’s infant born two months too soon. It was a gift that his father carved in haste, neither eating nor sleeping, in order to finish it by dawn the day after the birth. Within hours after a peaceful nap in the cradle, the child stopped struggling to nurse, and thrived thereafter.

“Come with your daughter to my workshop tomorrow,” the master carpenter continued, waving away Rhodri’s stammering gratitude. “I’ll draw up the plans and we can talk about them over supper.” He gestured to Lewys as he turned, a slight smile on his lips. “Let’s go. Enough stories for today. Back to chopping wood, lad.”

The aged puppet master did not answer Lewys’s question, but he did not have to.  There was no sign of his daughter among the clutter of tools, wood, parchment, and ink pots on the table. Clothes spilled out of a trunk, child’s dresses with snippets removed. A torn blanket lay rumpled on the floor. Lewys’s heart sank.

How foolish he had been to wait.

The puppet princess was sitting upright in a cabinet with the troll, dragon, and witch on a shelf beneath her. A pile of bedraggled puppets lay at the bottom.

“I’d like to commission you for repairs.”

Lewys looked at the rafters and walls, sunlight spearing through the gaps. Rhodri added, “I have the coin to pay you, whatever the cost.”

“It’s not that, sir.” He tried to control his tone, but anger still sharpened his words even after all these years. “There are no wytchen trees left.” One of the apprentices, addled with mead in the tavern, had broken his oath and spilled the secret of the grove; news that the master carpenter could release the trees’ magic had spread like fire afterwards. The townspeople turned on his father when he refused their foolish requests for wedding rings, pendants, furniture, even an entire house made from wytchen. But the final demand, a flagship, had come from the duke himself in his manor on the coast, delivered with a subtle threat on the carpenter’s son’s life.

The entire grove was consumed. His father had fallen ill during the ship’s crafting and died soon after it was completed.

“But surely you can repair the existing wood?”

Lewys regarded the puppet master, with his bent back and knotted bones, and said kindly, “All due respect, Master Rhodri, but perhaps a warm hearth in a home without wheels would serve you better now.”

The old man nodded. “It probably would. But,” he gestured to the puppets in the cabinet, “I must continue to tell her stories.”

The puppet princess was as finely crafted as porcelain, the warm scent of beeswax polish lingering on her milk-white skin of peeled wytchen wood. Lewys slipped his fingers along the gold cascade of her hair, a silken balm over his callused skin. He had touched Roselyn’s hair this way, shyly, so many years ago in the wytchen grove, as his father cut and shaped the wood for the pageant wagon. The elder Lewys murmured words under his breath as he worked, words that he whispered in Rhodri’s ear when he handed him small blocks of wytchen.

Coaxed by his daughter, Master Rhodri had fashioned them both toy swords out of plain oak. Lewys and Roselyn pretended they were heroes, fighting trolls and witches, befriending dragons, crafting their own fairy tales from shadows at the forest’s edge. Lewys was awkward and reluctant at first, feeling as if he were too old for this play, but Roselyn’s earnest imagination captivated him. And it was worth the teases of the other apprentices just to sit close to Roselyn afterwards, their heads touching, as she penned their play into stories for the puppets.

Her lips were always stained blush from the wytchen berries they were not supposed to eat, the red berries marked with stars that she hid in her dress pocket. When the pageant wagon was completed, oiled and shining like the moon, Lewys watched as it rolled away from the grove without need of a horse, Roselyn blowing kisses as she peeked out from behind the curtain. When it was gone, he ate the berry she had slipped into his hand with a whispered promise.

It had flooded his mouth with bitterness, the taste surprising him after a her sweetly-scented breath.

Lewys finally asked the question he had been dreading. “Roselyn is happily married, then?” He tried not to sound bitter, but her name was no longer sweet in his mouth either.

“No. She is not. I wish . . .” Rhodri took a deep, shaky breath. “Her heart just . . . stopped.” The words were a hammer blow to Lewys, leaving him cold and numb, his mouth drier than bone. His fingers, still caressing the puppet’s hair, froze. “One minute she was reading aloud her new story and the next . . . It was soon after we left the grove. I don’t know what happened.”

The old man paused, wiping his eyes with a grimy handkerchief from his pocket. “My wife had died when Roselyn was an infant. My daughter was all I had. My heart lies in that grave with her.  To keep living, to keep going . . .” His voice cracked, and he cleared his throat. “I wanted to save her, to bring her back to life. Impossible I know, but a father will do anything for his child . . . at least, like this, she can live on in her stories. The stories that she loved, that she lived to write. Her legacy.” He reached out and touched the puppet’s hair also. “Roselyn and her mother had the same color hair. It is beautiful, isn’t it?”

Lewys snapped his hand away, stumbling over the puppet detritus spilling out from the cabinet’s bottom.

“You must understand — I could not let her go! But she grew so cold . . . her hair was the only thing unchanged. It was the only thing still her.” The old man twisted his hands, choking back a sob. “Everything I did, all my carving, was for my daughter. She was the meaning behind my life’s work. She still is. And I have to give her what life I can.”

Master Rhodri’s struggle to contain his grief echoed in Lewys’s own hollow chest. After a moment, he said, “I do understand.”

Slowly Lewys collected the puppets from the floor, a mess of small swords and fractured oak limbs. All princes. “Can I fix these for you?” he asked.

Composing himself, shaking his head, the puppet master replied, “They were my gifts, to commemorate her birthdays.” He cleared his throat again.  “She never got the chance to create a story of true love. I thought perhaps I could write one for her. But the words never came, and the princes never worked right. And I’d find them damaged the next day. If they were made of wytchen, perhaps it would be different, but I used all the blocks your father gave me. Nevertheless, I keep trying, every year.”

Lewys was silent for a while, his hands cradling the broken princes. Wytchen dust drifted down from the wagon’s ceiling, glittering bright as a promise that had not been broken after all.

I will come back to you.

“I will do something for you, Master Rhodri. And for her.”

Back in his room he packed a satchel with a flask of water and food from his meager pantry, then secured a hatchet to his belt. Walking through the bare patch that had once been the grove, he glanced behind him, making sure he was alone before entering the thick forest beyond. He had released the apprentices after the flagship was completed; his destination was a secret only he knew, now.

After an hour, the woodland sloped upwards as the pine trees thinned. He came to a ledge where a single tree grew, slanted trunk and low, leafy branches thriving against the crisp sky: The wytchen sapling that Lewys and his dying father had transplanted here, hidden from human greed. It was larger now, although not as thick and full as the ancient ones in the grove had been. Another sapling, perhaps a year or two old, grew in a sunny spot near its parent. Lewys swallowed the sudden lump in his throat.

He poured water on the roots as an offering, giving some to the sapling as well, and tied a red ribbon around a thick branch as he had seen his father do. Then he sat, the trunk pressing into his jerkin, thinking of what could have been, while the sun painted the sky the color of the princess’s gown, of Roselyn’s lips, which had never touched his. As the sun descended into the dark forest below him, he hefted his hatchet and spoke his request to the tree.

He hoped he was worthy.

When Lewys came back to the wagon Rhodri was snoring in a corner, blanket wrapped around him and tucked under his grizzled chin. He used the old man’s tools, peeling and smoothing the small branch the wytchen had granted him, carving a face, body, and limbs, whispering his father’s words to the wood for the first and last time. Rummaging through the trunk, he found the remnants of a white shawl which he cut with a pair of silver scissors to make a doll-size tunic and pants, needle and red thread moving as deftly as when he sewed patches into his own clothing.  He painted the eyes and mouth.

Lewys took the puppet princess down from her shelf, arranging her carefully on the work table next to the newly carved prince, staring at her for a long time. He touched her hair again. Leaning close, his lips almost touching her cheek, he breathed deeply. As his lungs filled with her wytchen wood scent, his heart returned, brimming with magic and love as when they had been younger. “Roselyn,” he murmured, “I kept my promise too. I waited.”

With the scissors he cut his own hair off, and stitched the dark locks to a small felt cap. Uncorking a bottle of pine resin, he brushed the thick glue on the cap and attached it to the puppet prince’s head.

Wooden hands twitched, clacked against each other.

Lewys’s joints buckled and he flopped to the floor.

His name, whispered against his cheek. A whiff of familiar berry.

Lewys opened his eyes. He was sitting in the old wytchen grove under one of the trees, crisscrossing branches spread out above him, and for one disorienting moment he thought the branches were the rafters of the pageant wagon.

Someone was sitting next to him. He turned, and Roselyn’s smiling face filled his vision. Reaching out, tentatively, to touch her cheek, he whispered, “Are you real?” His fingers felt strange, stiff.

She laughed. “As real as you,” she replied, standing. A pile of berries cascaded from her billowing silk skirts. She pulled him to his feet, and his joints cracked loudly. Lewys pushed the aches in his body aside — Roselyn was here, in front of him, alive and looking more beautiful in a sunset-colored gown than he had ever beheld. Her hair was a curtain of golden strands over her shoulders, a net of crystals holding the strands away from her perfect face.

“I am glad you are finally here, with me, my love,” Roselyn whispered, standing so close to him, her eyes sparkling. Lewys folded her into his arms, his heart overflowing, seeking out her lips with his own.

“Not yet,” she said, placing her fingers over his mouth. A loud roar sounded from the depths of the forest. Roselyn broke from his grasp. “Father wrote us a story. I don’t know all the details, but I know it has a happy ending. We have to work to get there, of course.” She gestured to the sword buckled at his hip and, when he stared at it dumbfounded, unsheathed it for him and put it in his hand. The blade was etched with runes. “You’re a prince, Lewys.”

She pulled a matching sword from a concealed fold in her gown. “I found this one hidden in a wytchen trunk before you came.”

Another roar, closer this time, shook the leaves of the trees. Both sword blades began to glow.

“An enchantment! But do you know why?” Prince Lewys asked.

“No,” Princess Roselyn said excitedly. “I suppose we will have to figure it out! Remember that friendly dragon? Things aren’t always what they seem. We must be clever as well as brave.” She smiled up at Lewys, and he had never known such happiness, such excitement.

“We have a new life ahead of us, my love,” Roselyn said, and Lewys ached to kiss her. “Are you ready for adventure?”

Magic fell in curls and crystals from the wytchen wood above them. Strange shadows began to move beneath their feet. Lewys took his true love’s hand, and together they turned to face the beginning of their story. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Circle of Memories
By Jessica Meats
Cara brought her hand up to her face and was surprised to find wetness there. She looked at the damp ghosts of tears glistening on her fingertips and wondered what she’d been crying about. On the other side of the ritual circle, the witch held a small crystal, which was still glowing with the magic it had just absorbed.

“That must have been a powerful memory,” the witch commented. The witch was younger than Cara might have expected, her hair a mess of untidy, endearing waves. She met Cara’s gaze with eyes full of sympathy.

Cara blinked away the last of her tears. The confusion was less easy to blink away.

“Do you know what the memory was?” she asked.

The witch shook her head. “I don’t see the memories during the ritual, and you didn’t tell me what it was.”

She held the crystal out and Cara, still feeling a little dazed, accepted it. It was cold in her hand, but tingled with the promise of magic. Cara’s magic, that she’d traded something powerful for, something she now didn’t know. Her memories of coming in here and asking for the ritual were vague, like looking through fog, all the details obscured. She looked about the room as though seeing it for the first time, noting the mess of cluttered jars, the herbs drying from the beams, stubs of old candles, cups and bowls that needed washing, and the big book open on a worktable. It was the room of someone too busy to be preoccupied with tidying. Cara itched to move the tea cup further away from the jars of strangely coloured liquids, just to ensure there was no absent-minded mishap there. But it wasn’t her place to start tidying some stranger’s workshop, or to braid those curls back so the ends didn’t dip into anything.

Cara shook herself before she lost herself in imagining running her fingers through that soft hair or anything else equally inappropriate.

“What happens now?” she asked.

“Our transaction is complete. I’ve taken my portion of the magic. The rest is yours to use for whatever purpose you may have.”

Purpose. It sounded so simple when the witch said it, but when Cara tried to remember what had brought her to the witch’s house and her ritual circle, only emptiness remained.

The practice of trading memories for magic was an old one. The more significant the memory, the more magic it could provide. A memory of a normal, summer’s day could bring enough magic to ease a toothache, while the memory of a beloved relative’s final words could earn enough magic to conjure a mound of treasure. It was said that some of the greatest magic workers had traded away even the memories of their own names to earn their power.

“I don’t remember why I wanted this,” Cara said.

“Sometimes the forgetting is more important than the magic they hope to gain.”

Cara thought of the tears she had been crying. That would make sense if she had wanted to forget something bad.

But what should she do with the magic now? She didn’t want to waste it on something trivial, not when there were people who sacrificed greatly for the wonders that magic could do.

The witch stood, dusting off her skirts, and left the ritual circle. She poured a cup of water from a jug on the crowded worktable, offering it to Cara as she had done the crystal. This was no longer part of the transaction though, this was a simple act of kindness. Cara stood and took the cup, sipping slowly, waiting for her thoughts to rearrange themselves into order around the pieces that were missing. There seemed to be a lot of missing pieces. When she thought about leaving here, she faced another alarming emptiness in her mind.

“I don’t remember where my home is,” she said. There were memories of a childhood home, but they were distant, vague through the mere passage of time and not the influence of magic. There was nothing more recent.

She could use the magic to create money, to buy a new house and live quite comfortably for many years, but that seemed a selfish thing to do with such a wealth of power.

“There is a spare bed here,” the witch offered. “You could stay a while, until you decide what you want to do with your future.”

“Thank you.” Cara felt that she might begin crying again, from gratitude this time.

The witch smiled. “My name is Elner. You are welcome here.”

Elner had a store of books in her house, many written out by hand by previous magic workers. She was kind enough to let Cara read them while she considered what to do with the magic she now possessed. Cara read about spells of healing, spells to encourage plant growth, and spells to create a spring of fresh water in a desert. Cara read these books, imagining all the ways she might make the world better, might help people, with the crystal of power she kept tucked into the pocket of her shirt.

In between, she made herself useful, tidying the clutter that Elner left lying around, preparing meals, taking food and drink into the busy workshop where Elner tried out spells and potions with such an intense passion that she seemed to forget the needs of her body.

“I don’t know how you survived before I got here,” Cara commented, placing a bowl of pottage down on the table while Elner blinked at her with eyes shadowed from lack of sleep.

Elner frowned a little. “Maybe there was someone else?”

That would make sense, but the little bedroom at the back of the house had felt musty with disuse, so it had clearly been a while since anyone had slept there. The fact that Elner didn’t remember might have been worrying, but magic workers were like that, scattered and forgetful as they offered up trivial pieces of their past to fuel their spells. Cara knew that somehow though she did not remember ever having met another magic worker.

On the third day, a man arrived with a boy in his arms, the boy crying at a broken leg. Cara helped clear the space in the ritual circle for the boy and his father to both fit in, the father offering his own memory to power the boy’s healing.

Elner was calm and kind, offering gentle words to both boy and father, giving the boy a potion that she said would dull the pain while she worked. She set the bone back into position while the boy sobbed into his father’s shirt, saying that the more she could do practically, the less magic she would need. The less memory she would need to take.

When she was ready, Elner sat in the ritual circle across from her patient, and Cara lingered in the corner of the workshop to watch, curious about the procedure. Elner instructed the man to focus on a memory he would be willing to sacrifice, and faint lines of light appeared as the magic wove around them. Standing on the outside, she was able to see what someone inside the ritual circle would struggle to notice: the direction the magic was flowing and its relative strength. Pale lights floated from the father toward Elner, and she directed brighter lights out, weaving them around the boy’s leg, knitting together the injured bone. Elner was using her own magic, at least partially, to fuel the spell.

Did the father know? Probably not. He thanked Elner for her help and dropped a handful of copper pieces into her offering plate before leaving with his son walking strongly at his side.

Cara continued to watch as Elner went to a thick book on her worktable and began writing in careful, neat lettering. Elner seemed not to notice that Cara was there, but when Cara brought her food later that day, she flipped open the big book to satisfy her curiosity. Each page was filled with records of spells cast, mostly for healing but also the other requests people summoned a witch for: helping with a poor harvest, diverting floodwaters, and tending of beasts. Elner captured the details of each spell, but also how the people had reacted, the way it had felt, the words of thanks they had offered. She printed the incidents on the paper of her book so that they would never be lost.

“Do you remember any of these?” Cara asked.

Elner, in the middle of eating the pigeon Cara had prepared for her, looked up and saw what she was reading. She swallowed, not quite meeting Cara’s eyes.

“Only the latest one.”

“That must cost you a lot, to give up your memories of spells cast.”

“Better that I can cast more spells. I use the memory of each one to fuel the next, and it means other people don’t have to lose something that matters to them.”

Cara was overwhelmed by the kindness in that gesture, the knowledge that Elner would give so much to help others and never even tell anyone, never want so much as a trace of praise for it. That was why she worked so hard at her magic: she wanted to make the world better with her whole heart and she would give up everything inside her to make it happen if that was what was required. Cara thought of her own store of magic, the store she had yet to determine a purpose for, and felt selfish for holding on to it instead of just giving it over to Elner to work wonders with. She was still thinking that, as she closed the book and caught a glimpse of what was written on the first page.

Your name is Elner.

She only knew her own name because she’d written it in her book. At some point along the way, she had traded away her memory of her own name, of every moment a person had addressed her by it, of every private thought she’d had about it, any conversations about her name’s meanings and any nicknames or terms of endearment that might have been based on it. All of that stripped away and left only as a word upon a page. And how many times had she forgotten her name since then? How many times had she given it up just so that someone else wouldn’t need to make so large a sacrifice to power a healing spell?

Cara looked Elner in the eyes and said, “You are incredible. Your kindness is unfathomable.”

Elner blushed a little, looking away. “I just do what needs to be done. Anyone else would do the same when they see children sick and parents crying.”

But other people didn’t do that. The world was full of people who sought magic for selfish reasons, not to try and heal every sick child. Cara couldn’t let Elner dismiss her own goodness so easily. She reached out and caught Elner’s hand, feeling the skin roughened by callouses and hard work.

“You are a wonder,” Cara said.

Elner’s blush deepened and she looked away, ducking her head as though to hide the shy smile that graced her lips. Cara didn’t think she’d ever seen anything so beautiful as that smile.

A man from the nearest village came once a week with food and supplies. He didn’t seem surprised to see Cara there, just greeted her warmly and discussed the supplies, asking what else they might need. Elner’s garden was given over to mostly herbs for her potions, so Cara was glad of the offerings of foodstuffs and she had plenty to ensure that Elner was well fed and strong enough for her work. The first time he came, the man refused payment and seemed a little surprised that Cara had offered. He said that the services Elner gave them as healer were payment enough; the food was supplied by the village as a whole for her patronage.

So Cara took the food and prepared meals. She kept the house clean and made sure to drag Elner off to bathe or sleep as she required, since she seemed unable to regulate herself, capable of getting lost in her work until days had passed. As Cara shepherded her to bed one night, Elner murmured, “I don’t know why you put up with me.”

“Because you’re kind and clever and too busy taking care of the rest of the world to look after yourself.”

“You’re kind,” Elner countered.

“Nothing compared to you.”

“You’re kind to me.”

She caught hold of Cara’s hand and tugged her closer, bringing their mouths together for a kiss. Cara was so surprised that all she could do was stand there. After a moment, Elner seemed to realise what she had done. She snapped to attention like someone waking from sleep-walking and stepped back, dropping Cara’s hand like it burned.

“Sorry,” she said. “I shouldn’t have done that.”

Cara saw the regret and sorrow written across Elner’s face and would have done anything to wipe them away. She wanted to make Elner smile again, the way she had when she’d called her a wonder. Cara reached out and took Elner’s hand in her own again, drawing her back.

“We’ll talk about this in the morning,” she said, “when you’ve had a chance to sleep.” And then, to show that this wasn’t a refusal, she leaned in and pressed a light kiss over Elner’s lips.

“In the morning,” she repeated.

Now Cara had a new way to draw Elner away from her work when she was buried too deeply in potions and spells. She lured her to the bedroom with kisses and smiles, distracting her with pleasure and then watching her slip into contented sleep. Soon the little bedroom at the back of the house stood empty again, and Cara slept with her arms around Elner, or lying in the pool of warmth she’d left when she slipped out early to get back to work.

Cara learned which dishes were Elner’s favourites, and which tricks in the bedroom would make her squeal with joy. She took care of Elner as best she could, but sometimes she didn’t have to drag Elner from her work. Sometimes Elner surprised her, like the morning she awoke early not to start brewing potions but so that she could prepare the breakfast for once, decorating the table with a bunch of wildflowers.

When a woman left a bolt of dyed cloth in payment for a spell to bring home a lost sheep, Elner had insisted that Cara take the cloth for herself, as a gift.

Elner showered her with affection for the smallest of things, and Cara did her best to ensure she earned that affection. For the first time since her arrival here, she had stopped thinking about the magic in her pocket, about the purpose she might have had once or the home she had forgotten. This was her home. Nothing else was important. She had Elner, and as long as they had each other, they would be happy.

Then a man came, riding up in the night on a horse that looked half-dead from the exertion. He pounded on the door with cries of plague and pleas for the witch to come save his town. Of course, Elner agreed at once to help. Cara packed up the bags and boxes of supplies and then ran to the village to request the loan of a cart and pony.

It took them four days to reach the town. They could smell the pyres for the dead many hours before the buildings came into sight. They met the first of the townsfolk along the way. Some were fleeing for their lives, but others had come to meet them, knowing that a witch had been summoned. One old woman who looked barely able to stand clutched a boy to her chest, his face flushed with fever. The last of her grandchildren, she said, as she begged for magic to save him.

Elner drew the ritual circle in the dust of the road and set to work, the boy so far gone that the woman had to lose the memories of all her other grandchildren to save this one, even with the tell-tale glow showing that Elner was giving of herself as well. She couldn’t take memories from the boy himself because he was unconscious. Elner had explained once that a person had to be consciously focusing on the memories to take otherwise she might end up taking anything, with no way to differentiate between the trivial and the crucial. She might take someone’s most treasured memory, or their memory of how to speak or read, or even how to breathe. It had been the first warning in one of the books in Elner’s collection, so for all those who were sick beyond the point of awareness, someone else had to be willing to sacrifice of themselves to save them.

As they continued towards the town, others stopped them along the way, offering nothing more than pleas in payment for the healings of their loved ones, and Elner stopped for each and every one. The rituals seemed to take too long, the power too strong and the lights too bright. Cara didn’t know a great deal about magic, despite her reading of Elner’s books, but she’d been witness to enough rituals of healing to wonder at the length of time this was taking. As she helped Elner to stand afterwards and boosted her back into the cart so that they could continue to the town, she asked about it.

“There’s something magical in the sickness,” Elner said. “Maybe it started as a curse. It has the feel of a true disease and seems to behave as one, but it’s more vicious, filling its victims with pains and fever dream terrors. At its heart there is a core of magic. That takes more power to dispel.”

“Why would someone use precious magic to create an illness?” Cara asked. She could understand those who used magic for personal gain, or to buy security in an uncertain world, but using magic to create something that would cause only suffering seemed abominable. It didn’t seem Elner had an answer for her either.

As the town became visible, Cara wondered how a place of such size managed not to have a healer of its own, but that question was soon answered as they approached the town square and the man who had fetched them brought them over to an older man who was sitting in a ritual circle of his own, tending to a pregnant woman.

When the healing was complete, Elner went to introduce herself. Then man smiled and started to return the greeting.

“Hello Elner, I’m…” and then he faltered and looked puzzled. After a moment, that puzzlement changed to sadness and he finished simply, “Oh.”

It was clear that Elner wasn’t the only one who gave herself to rituals.

“Arrin,” said their guide. “Our healer.”

An overwhelmed healer in the midst of destruction he couldn’t fight. Elner took her place in his circle and they worked together to cure all those who came begging for aid. It was clear that they were struggling, and Cara felt the weight of the crystal in her pocket, a store of magic waiting for a purpose. What better purpose could there be than this?

When Elner took a moment between rituals to take a drink of water, Cara held the crystal out towards her.

“I can’t take this,” Elner said.

“You can do more good than I ever could with it,” Cara answered. She placed the crystal in Elner’s hand and closed her fingers over it, letting their hands stay linked for several moments longer than was necessary.

There was gratitude on Elner’s face and something else, something deeper. She reached out and drew Cara in for a kiss. Then she got back to work.

Cara helped in what little ways she could, offering water to the sick, holding frightened children while their parents were tended, or just answering the same questions a hundred times for the people who felt like their worlds were ending. She tried to stay calm through the terror as the day faded into night and the lights of the rituals continued on through darkness and exhaustion because the sickness wouldn’t yield and so neither would Elner.

Sometime late into the night, Cara felt the first wave of dizziness overwhelm her but she dismissed it as simple tiredness. She couldn’t just seek out a bed while Elner was still working, so she ignored those feelings and pressed on, but when she carried the cup of water to her lover between healings, Elner frowned at her with concern.

“Are you alright?” she asked and reached out a hand to rest on Cara’s forehead. “You’re burning up.”

In that moment, Elner looked as frightened as any of the townsfolk.

“I’ll be alright,” Cara said. But then the world shifted around her, the buildings no longer so solid and the ground beneath her feet felt like the ocean in a storm. She collapsed into Elner’s arms and tried to think of something clever to say about this situation, some way to tease Elner into a smile with a comment about how all this had been a ploy to get her arms around her. But all thoughts of joking faded at the look of horror on Elner’s face.

“I’ll be alright,” Cara said again. “The best healer in the realm is looking out for me.”

“I don’t have enough strength left,” Elner said. Her eyes were damp, sparkling like stars that seemed to dance as Cara’s vision wavered. “I used up the crystal’s store. I don’t have anything left to give.”

Those words were the last thing Cara heard before she slipped into a darkness inhabited by formless shapes of fear. The dreams had no consistency, no substance, just a feeling of dread that washed over her in waves before slipping away again. A few times, Cara became aware of hands on her and voices nearby, but which came from the dreams and which came from the waking world, she couldn’t tell. Each time she came close to waking, the shapeless fears came to drag her back down into the nightmare world.

And then the nightmares were gone.

Cara was lying in a ritual circle, her sweat-soaked skin chill in the night air. The sky was starting to brighten so she could see clearly as, across the circle, Elner wiped tears from her cheek and studied the dampness on her fingertips with a puzzled air, as if she couldn’t remember what she had been crying about.

“What happened?” Cara asked.

“You were sick with a magical fever,” Elner said. “Don’t worry. I’m a witch. I healed you.”

“I know you’re a witch.” Cara pushed herself into a sitting position. The square was quieter than it had been earlier. Most of the sick had been dealt with before she’d succumbed, and so there were few others about, and those who were nearby were giving them enough distance to grant privacy.

“I suppose the circle makes it obvious,” Elner said. She gave a gentle smile, but it was the reassuring look of kindness she gave all her patients, not the bright, private smile that she usually gave Cara. That was when Cara knew: Elner didn’t remember her. Elner had sacrificed her memories of their relationship to save her from the fever.

Cold dread settled in Cara’s stomach, worse than anything the nightmares had brought. She saw the blankness in her lover’s eyes and almost wished she’d never woken up. As Elner stood and walked away from her, Cara wanted to call out, to beg her to stay, to hunt her eyes for some sign of recognition, but the words didn’t come. Cara sat on the stone paving of the town square and wept.

She couldn’t even be angry with Elner. After all, if their places were reversed, Cara knew she would give anything to protect Elner, to keep her safe and well. But what was she supposed to do now?

She couldn’t just walk away. She could go after Elner and tell her about them, remind her, but it wouldn’t be the same. Would it hurt more to try and rebuild their love when Elner didn’t know her at all? It seemed unbalanced, unfair on both of them that only one could remember all they had been.

Unless that was the answer. Cara could forget too. They had fallen in love once before when they had been strangers. She could trust that they would fall in love again. Without their memories, put together in the same way, they would fall in love every single time because there was no possible world where Cara wouldn’t see Elner’s kindness and be awed by it, where she wouldn’t do all in her power to take care of her, to be worthy of her. It would be a fresh start for both of them, a blank slate that they could build on all over again, entering the relationship as equals. They had been happy before and they would be happy again, Cara was sure of it. She trusted in the strength of their love to keep them together, even without their memories.

So when Elner returned home, Cara followed. She walked into that little house in the woods and looked at the woman who looked back so blankly and announced that she wanted to trade a memory for magic.

As she sat down in the ritual circle, Cara thought about the spare bed in the house and the way the man from the village had been unsurprised by her presence, the way Elner hadn’t known if someone had taken care of her before. As the lights of the ritual rose about them, Cara couldn’t help wondering how many times she had sat in this position. How many times had they fallen in love only to forget it? And how many times more would they have to?

It didn’t matter, she told herself, thinking back over all that they had shared, all the memories she was about to lose. Their love was strong enough to survive. If she had to fall in love with Elner a hundred times over, she would, she promised herself as tears ran down her cheeks. She felt that thought dissolve like mist in the morning sun, leaving calm emptiness behind.

Cara brought her hand up to her face and was surprised to find wetness there. <|endoftext|>

Early mornings, before the tourists show up, Gordon Barrow likes to lean against the hotel roof and watch the trains. There are two of them, each carriage as big as his size seven shoes, and they circle the village at a leisurely pace, with a gap of about nine or ten feet in between them. Today, nearing winter, steam wreathes the whole track, and the engines race onwards through each other’s ghost.

He takes out his hip-flask — with ‘Teesside’ engraved on it — and has a quick swig of the whisky it carries, telling himself it’s to keep out the chill.

He thinks of his father; looks at the church.

It’s one of many reminders of his childhood around here, in the stone of this village. Actual sandstone, dressed by actual masons, set down by school kids from his time and after. He’d personally laid many of the blocks in the hotel — formerly the manor house — which is why he often stands beside it. He feels sure that it will not collapse with his weight.

Some of the cars as well, they had been his. The older, tin-chassis ones. A Rolls Royce Silver Phantom that was the pride of his collection now rests by the door of the old village hall. A pair of Mini Coopers, one red and one blue, are parked half on the kerb a short way down the road. A rust-freckled E-type on a cul-de-sac driveway, with a figurine placed by the passenger door, to cover the void where it should have a wheel. An old cream and brown bus by the solitary stop; never driving its appointed route, but then never late either.

Timing is important.

Gordon keeps track of everything, due-dates for bills, for bank statements, electricity readings, in a series of pads on the desk by his bed.

Routine is important.


Every day, before the tourists arrive, he parades along each street in turn. He stops at each house and peers down at the gardens, their hedgerows and fences; savours the crystalline shimmer of dew. Bends to reach and rectify any resident or lawnmower that might have been felled by the wind overnight; brushes cobwebs from the bonsai that are set in each lawn. Little beeches and birches, a few Japanese maples. There’s even a laburnum, bare at the minute, but which in summer trails flowers like miniature corn.

He checks nothing’s missing. Checks all the delicate windows for cracks; paying particular attention to those in the hotel, and the stained-glass arches that cap three of the four sides of the church. But this is more out of habit than because he suspects there’ll be anything wrong.

The village proper has always been of the type that one might call idyllic. Traditional. Full of old and well-established families and businesses; not a chain-store or a supermarket anywhere in sight. Of course, it had not been without a small criminal element, though whatever minor misdemeanours have occurred there through the years, none have ever been copied out here. Not on his watch. And at least this version isn’t afflicted by the roadworks he hears, banging on in the distance. At least nothing gets nicked or besmirched with graffiti. Not really.

People, even tourists, seem to respect the things they’re bigger than; albeit in a different way than they respect those that are bigger than them.

There is, he imagines, in each of them a lurking, latent notion that they could all too easily run amok and smash buildings at will. Perhaps especially in any of the locals that visit. The sense that they could raze the abode of their irritating neighbour, or the primary school, or even the replica of their own house, if the stress of the mortgage payments and the extensions and general maintenance has all become too much.

Yet they exercise mercy, and feel better for it.

They become saviours here. Life is in their control.

Away on the fringes, Gordon feels like he is in control, too. Sometimes. He feels special. No, maybe not special, but useful, which is all he has ever really wanted to be. He wouldn’t say he feels godlike — brought up as he was, that still rings sacrilegious — though he is almost priestly; safeguarding values and keeping the faith.

Except, that faith has been lately disturbed by those signs. That’s the one problem.

‘Sale!’ signs.

‘Half-price!’

‘Everything must go!’

On the inside of shop windows. Sometimes there, sometimes not. Almost like make-believe, but the kind that feels true. The kind he remembers from back in his childhood. Not the long Sunday mornings in the front pew at church, gazing up at the lectern. But the faraway school-nights of being six and seven, and the small copse of trees beyond the back garden fence.

There had been circles of wild mushrooms, toadstools, in the shelter of lumbering ashes and elms. It was his older sister, Jemima, who pointed them out. She’d delighted in escorting him along the shadier paths in that body of trees, and as he’d gripped her hand tightly and rushed to keep up, that was usually when she had told him her tales.

They would often be about the Olden Days, as she called them, when that copse joined the forest that spanned the whole country. She told him how ancient, magnificent knights had once roamed through that woodland, from the North to the South, to protect it from goblins, and great flocks of dragons, and legions of wolves.

At the mention of which she would freeze and go quiet, as though waiting to hear such an animal howling, or otherwise licking its slobbering jaws. He would shiver at that, and grasp her hand even tighter, till she looked down and said, “Don’t tell me you’re scared?”

But he always shook his head, and pushed his shoulders back and chin upright, the way he’d seen his father do whenever his mother used a similar tone. And so Jem carried on.

She told him how, in the Olden Days, one of the knights had decided he would no longer patrol. The woodland had shrunk because of too much ill magic, and too many trees had been burnt down by dragons, and so he decided it was unfair to risk the lives of his fellows by making them ride through the wide open plains.

Instead, he felt the best way to keep his people safe was to build them a castle. It took him six years — “That’s how old I am!” said Gordon, awe-struck and beaming — but it was worth the time and the effort, because it was the most astonishingly powerful and beautiful castle there had ever been or would ever be. This knight, she said, had called it Camelot, and when they saw what he had made, his people crowned him King.

“And where was it?” said Gordon, squeezing her fingers.

“Well,” she leaned closer, “it was actually here.”

When Gordon was six, he’d believed almost anything. Now sixty-two, there’s the fear he’s sliding back into such gullibility. Or, worse still, that his eyes or his mind, or both, are degrading.

If that’s not the case, then where have the signs come from? And how have they got there? Actually inside, behind the glass. The doors do not open; the roofs won’t lift off.

He’s tried.

Also, those posters aren’t there all the time. That’s the thing. He wouldn’t be so taken with doubt if they were.

Maybe he’d only started spotting them after the funeral — that’s something he worries. That he’s been seeing things that aren’t real because he can’t stand the coldness of anything that is. That he’s been drinking much more than he reasonably should.

Exceeding his weekly limit, as his doctor would have cautioned.

Though, he doesn’t go to see his doctor any more.

He doesn’t really go to see anyone in particular. And even the people he can’t avoid, the ones who come here, he keeps at a distance, as much as he can.

He should probably make more of an effort to remember their faces, on the off-chance they do ever visit again, if only so as he can keep up a count of such regulars — it might show the Council he’s being proactive, doing market research, which he knows that they like. But it’s easier, he’s discovered, to let them blur into a unified mass.

Tourists, he calls them. Even the locals that sometimes come down.

Besides, whenever he has made eye-contact lately, the expression he’s been met with has not set him at ease. Particularly when someone’s gone out of their way to be noticed. “Only the troublemakers stray from the herd,” his father had told him. Or was it “the troubled”? He can’t quite be sure.

Occasionally, a tourist, or more often a few, will loiter by a certain shop, as if something untoward or obscene has occurred, though they can’t say for certain that this is the case. Maybe those ‘Sale!’ signs, that whitewash, are meant to be there? They look towards Gordon to confirm or deny.

Yes, that is how it should be, he assures them.

Admitting that something is askew or off-kilter would hamper the peace that they’ve come here to find.

“Why can’t I see Camelot?” Gordon had asked her.

“What?”

“If Camelot was so near, then how come I can’t see it?” He was thinking of other castles they’d visited, on holiday in Wales.

She turned around to shush him, and then carried on walking over slick, dead leaves and breaking twigs, her eyes clearly fixed on the autumnal ground. He was eager to repeat his unanswered question, but not to disturb Jemima’s focus. She did have a temper on her, after all, as their father had often remarked.

A minute or so later, she came to a stop, which he took as a signal to ask her again.

“Where’s Camelot now?”

“It’s right there,” she told him. “It’s just difficult to see.”

“Why, though?”

“Well…that’s just how the King wanted it.”

“It is?”

“Yes.”

“But…why?”

She’d actually seemed stumped by this for a moment, and looked down again, then up again, and then at him. “Because the wolves kept on getting much wilder and hungrier, and the dragons got bigger and breathed more and more fire, and the forest kept shrinking, and so at last the King told his most trusted magician he wanted the castle to be shrunk down as well. Because that was the only way he could keep people safe.”

Gordon had stared up at her — he remembers this vividly — and felt utterly entranced. By that image. By the idea of a magic capable of such an otherwise impossible thing.

“So, how can I see it?” he asked, almost dancing with excitement.

Jemima looked down and he followed her stare.

“This is a fairy ring. It holds a tiny version of Camelot, and it’s guarded by fairies. The magician made a deal with them, and they swore to keep it hidden from all of their enemies, and only reveal it to those who believed.”

Gordon crouched to inspect it, peering intensely at the small, wonky mushrooms with their red and white caps. A woodlouse or something climbed one of the stems. Leaves were on the dirt between them, halfway rotted to the bones.

“I can’t see the castle,” he told her, frustrated.

“Of course you can’t. You can’t even see the fairies. They’re too small. That’s how they stay so well hidden. But there is a way you can see it full-size…”

“How? How?!”

“You put one foot inside the ring, and then you close your eyes and say its name three times. And if the fairies think that you want to see it badly enough, and that you mean it no harm, then they’ll let you.”

She’d sounded so convincing back then. So authoritative. He did exactly as she’d said, and on the second try he saw it. The vastness of its pale and crenelated walls, the banners streaming down along them, the trumpets raised and catching light; the cloud-wreathed peaks of its myriad towers; the drawbridge, much larger and more impressive than the wrought-iron gates of his primary school.

He’d been utterly gobsmacked. Couldn’t stop smiling as he described it to Jem.

He developed a habit of going there every few days, even without her, and the more that he went, the more that he saw. The better he got at exploring the grounds. He would squeeze between the portcullis’ shiny steel bars, and take a tour of the courtyard, from the stables to the blacksmith, from the public well to the stocks to the archery range. Medieval strangers would smile at him and ruffle his hair — behaviour that seldom passed muster in his parents’ house — and maybe even throw him morsels of food; which he could taste, he swore, as he made his way back through the small copse of trees. He would burp, in the isolation of the field, amazed by the flavours that haunted his tongue.

Once or twice, he even snuck into the castle’s great hall, with the Round Table, with the shields and swords of all the knights laid out upon it, though none of those knights had been present themselves.

And from there on down into the cellar, a vast subterranean cavern, through the ceiling of which he saw the roots of trees like wires intruding, almost sparking in the darkness, flashing in the damp. He nearly opened his eyes, nearly ran, wanting sunlight through branches, the field, and the fence. But strode ahead, bravely, in between pillars, tearing through cobwebs, until at last he had come to the burial place.

The cold blue chamber in which the King had lain sleeping, on a slab, with Excalibur upon his chest. Ready to be woken — so Jemima had said — should his people ever need him to save them again.

It was the building of this place that had disillusioned him, a year later; that went most of the way towards breaking the spell.

He had thought, upon seeing the knuckle-sized bricks, that no building could possibly be smaller than these, enchanted or otherwise. But that hadn’t saddened him. In fact, the reverse. In the absence of any actual magic, he found himself fascinated with miniature craftsmanship, which, at the age of seven and three-quarters, had seemed more or less the next best thing.

That fascination had, before he scarcely knew it, become a lifelong passion. He never got too much into the manufacturing side, beyond contributing a new bus shelter when the first rusted through, but his real talent, his real calling, lay in curation. In keeping it safe and well cared for, and taking note of any subtle alterations, and doing what he could to set everything right.

Seeing these signs, it calls his talent into question. It makes him feel shaky, and he dreads the return of the dragons and wolves.

Which is why he’s come to prize the early morning stillness — the times he can push all those worries aside. The times he can knock back a few drams of whisky, and lose himself watching the circling trains. Trying his hardest to shut out the roadworks; the drilling and banging that drifts through the air.

But then the gates open. As the first group of tourists approach up the path, some of them crossing the grass by the railway, they seem spectral and sinister, especially when viewed through the trains’ veil of steam. They step through that ring without any acknowledgement, without any ceremony, as though it’s not even there. They scarcely miss cars by an inch, often less.

He can’t bear to look, when they near his Rolls Royce. He seeks the small church, with its miniature graveyard. Takes some deep breaths, as he tries and then fails not to think about her. Jemima. Tries not to think how it’s all ending up.

He can tell himself as much as he wants to what the tourists have come for — all that peace and control and contemplative sanctuary — but that won’t make it true. When he sees them all walking the streets without caution, without passion, he just doesn’t know. He doesn’t pay attention to their faces, not really, at least not as much as he watches their shoes. He is entranced — or incensed — by the prints that they leave. The mud that they trail on the thin strips of road.

On the days when it’s rained, when the surrounding field is churned up like a rugby pitch, he heads to his gatehouse and fetches the broom. He doesn’t follow them round, as much as he wants to, but saves it for later, his post-tour inspection. He waits until the coast is clear, and then swallows back most of what’s left in the flask, before sweeping the streets, and collecting the rubbish they’ve scattered as well.

Then he makes one more pass, checking for damage, for any slight changes. It is then he’s most likely to notice the signs. More now than ever. Including a window that’s been fully whitewashed; through the gaps in the paint, the insides look empty. Another with its shutters drawn down and then padlocked — though he didn’t even know it had shutters to start with.

In twenty or so years, he has seldom been absent. Has only rarely called in sick. Once, after slipping on some ice and fracturing a finger, and then when he caught a bad flu last December, and was laid up in hospital for nearly a week. Most days, he’s here a good while before opening, and stays until well after the tourists have left. So he isn’t sure when anything like that had been fitted.

The Council should have notified him if work had been done. He’d had it put into his contract they would.

He had received a letter from them about a week and a half ago, but hasn’t opened it yet. It’ll be his annual pension statement, though they’ve sent it through early, and he doesn’t really check all that stuff anymore. He is always aware what the numbers should be. He keeps track of them all in a pad on his desk. He keeps track of everything. He was always reliable, his father had said.

Jemima, though.

She’d been through a lot of jobs, and had moved away to do some of them. Her last one, in fact, had been all the way up north, just outside Middlesbrough. It was something an old boyfriend had managed to find her — out of pity, Gordon suspected — and which she only ever explained in the vaguest of terms. Something to do with imports and deliveries. Logistics, she called it. Even if he had found the words to ask, she probably wouldn’t have told him exactly what they were importing. Or she would have lied outright, and he’d have known she was lying, and still been none the wiser.

When he and his classmates were brought out here, one early-summer morning, and he’d first encountered these miniscule bricks, he’d felt something twist, rearranging inside him. Not just in relation to his ideas about magic, but also regarding his thoughts about Jem.

Before that point, whenever his parents had been arguing about her, he’d always jumped in to his sister’s defence.

That was to change.

He didn’t condemn her straight away — he didn’t understand what he was feeling straight away — but, despite being distracted by bricklaying, and the fact that he could see the roof of the hotel proper in the distance, he resolved to question her about it as soon as he got home.

He couldn’t do it at school, because she’d finally started making more friends her own age, and didn’t always want her young brother around. But he managed to catch her that evening before her new friends came calling, and asked her, cautiously, if she’d like to come with him for a walk in the woods. She nodded yes, curtly, and then they set off. His hands hurt a little as he vaulted the fence, from the work he’d done earlier, but he didn’t let on. He didn’t reveal anything, not until they reached the trees.

Then all he said was: “You lied to me, Jem.”

They’d no longer been holding hands on their walks, but he got the feeling that she would have let go if they had. Her temper was simmering under her skin; her cheeks and forehead flushing red.

“Lied about what?”

“About Camelot,” he said, doing his best not to blink.

“Oh?”

“You told me it was so tiny that I couldn’t see it, but I don’t think there is any building that size. I don’t think it’s possible.”

“Well, you won’t see it again, if you think things like that. The fairies won’t let you. I told you that as well, didn’t I?” He couldn’t be sure whether she was about to cry, or hit him, or both. As it turned out, she did neither. She simply stormed off.

He watched her, the sharp silhouette, as she broke out through the treeline; which already seemed thinner, like more of the copse had been burnt to a crisp. Then he turned and made his way along the path to the fairy ring, lying squat in the shade of a mouldy-barked ash.

He set his left foot inside it, and then closed his eyes. But he couldn’t see the drawbridge any longer. Or the high, pale walls, and the banners that draped brightly between crenellations. Or the cloud-spearing towers. Just the fading stripes of the trees that he’d been looking at beforehand, and was looking at again when he got tired of waiting.

He kept staring ahead as he stepped out of the circle.

As he lifted his foot back.

As he let it swing forwards in a swift little kick.

Only risked peering down again once it had landed, to see the ruins of those toadstools, their caps and stems splintered and ripped from the earth. Bits of them clung to the tip of his school shoe, which he wiped on the grass when he was back in the field.

Gordon takes another sip of whisky, but doesn’t like the lightness of the flask in his palm. He reaches and scratches the small whitewashed window, but no paint comes off. He ruffles the shutters on the bookshop nearby and they feel real enough, but then when he looks back the shutters are gone. So is the paint. The ‘Closing Down’ sign in the next shop as well.

He rises, a tad unsteadily, but doesn’t topple, and knows by heart the places on the street where it is safe for him to tread. He walks out of the village via the main road, and then crosses the railway, directly above one of the trains that has stalled.

It has never been his job to deal with the engines. They are usually running by the time he arrives, seen to by the engineer who built them in the first place. He’s just about the only other employee who comes out here, but he’s a doddery old bugger, so Gordon doubts he’d be capable of something like this. It isn’t his style. When they’ve talked in the past — that is, when they’ve traded a few words here and there — the older man has confided that, for him, it is “trains, always trains”. And Gordon, tending the buildings and streets as he does, believes that. Respects it.

But the Council, he doesn’t respect them. Lately, he senses the feeling is mutual. No matter how many times he has asked what would happen, and what was happening in his absence, when he’d travelled up north for her funeral, he had always got the same response.

“Don’t worry, it’s being taken care of.”

Three days of being three hundred miles from his village, and that was all he was told. He couldn’t fathom why. They’d been mostly alright on that front before, but not recently. There had been subtle alterations. Their timing had grown increasingly off. The early arrival of his annual pension statement was one more example to add to the list.

Feeling the rattle of the flask in his coat, he begins to worry that maybe someone has told them about his drinking. But that doesn’t make sense. He’s always so careful. Always makes sure that there’s no-one around if and when he has a nip. He doesn’t even go down the local for a pint any more.

Besides, he’d only started drinking like this after Jem passed away. He’d only bought this hip-flask the day after the funeral, as a kind of morbid souvenir. It says ‘Teesside’ on it. That’s where she’s buried. Not in this village, in their old family plot.

She hadn’t been back home, back here, for about eighteen months. Not even for Christmas, despite his invitations. Not even for his birthday. For either of his birthdays since he’d seen her last.

All she had said whenever he asked her was, “I don’t feel welcome down there anymore.” She’d fallen out with their parents many times through the years, and hadn’t quite patched things up by the time that they died; they had both caught some kind of hospital bug, and gone within a couple of weeks of each other.

After that, she had wanted more and more distance, more and more space. Whenever he did see her, she had a hounded, haunted look, as though all the temper of her youth had been turned back inside. Instead of seeming flushed, she grew paler whenever anyone said something enraging. Whenever he had been guilty of something like that.

Since she moved away, he’s become even less sociable. He’s never been one for having too many acquaintances, not since his school days, and so nobody really seems to miss him at the pub. Nobody who cares enough to call him up and ask him where he’s got to, anyway. And he makes sure not to pass it, and risk being seen through the windows, or to go anywhere else where he might still be recognised; prefers the most out-of-the-way route between here and his house — the house that his parents left him and not Jem.

Tonight, though, he takes the turning that leads through the big village.

Having thought about his parents, he feels the need to at least go and walk past the church.

As he gets closer to the centre, he can’t help but notice the state of the roads, and how the cones and temporary traffic lights are like Halloween decorations; to go with the pumpkins in some of the shops. He’s heard the drilling lately from his house in a morning, and from his version of the village, but has never yet been tempted to come and have a closer look. On top of everything else, he doesn’t like the smell of tar.

It appears that this isn’t simply a case of renewing the road surface, however — there are other, more substantial alterations on-going. They seem to be building another roundabout, for a start, to compliment the smaller one at the far end of the high street, and diverting the traffic while this is completed. Though, the need for such an eyesore is far from obvious to Gordon. Perhaps he could ask the workmen who sit idling in their van, but they don’t look too approachable, so he decides to press on.

He leans against the graveyard wall, peering at his parents’ headstones, which stand in the shade of the church’s east wing. The smell of the grass prognosticates rainfall. He wipes his nose. Reaches inside of his coat for the flask.

He likes the seclusion, the peace and quiet of the model village. He likes to be there for the calm of the dawn, when his heart and the trains are the only things moving. And maybe a blackbird, as tall as a house.

But he knows for certain, right at this moment, that he doesn’t like being alone.

Even the tourists are comforting, after a fashion. Watching them, he feels like his own problems are not really so big. He can put himself in their shoes — the shoes that he keeps track of, fastidiously — and look down at the houses, and then up at the other people, giants in comparison, and none of their fears seem as bad as all that.

Here, though, on the pavement below the raised ground of the churchyard, he isn’t safe in that knowledge. He feels tiny and wretched. The stones tower over him. The wall feels clammy. It is not as welcoming, as helpful, this church, as the miniature version. It doesn’t do its job the same.

Another swig, and he closes his eyes against the danger of weeping.

It takes a few seconds, but he sees himself, even smaller, slipping inside through a gap between stones. Into the mud, pushing down through the earth. The clumped roots of weeds, and the tendrils of fungi like cold iron chains; the bulbs of latent snowdrops and bluebells like torches.

Follow them, onwards, deeper and deeper. Past the spent shells of woodlice, like discarded saddles; past the still lengths of worms, dragons slain in the dark. Further and further, as though pulled, as though guided. Until the cold and the blue of an underground chamber, and his breath steams and circles his head like a halo. And in the middle are two slabs, and on them two bodies. And his father bears a cross on his chest like a sword.

Back at his house, he’s halfway through the fiddly business of refilling his hip-flask, before he finally twigs he can just use a glass. He pours it back out into a tumbler he’s taken, unwashed, from the worktop. Bids the cheap blended whisky godspeed to his gut.

Then downs another.

Finds his way, with the third glass, across the lounge to his armchair. Which was his father’s before him.

After the sixth glass, he finds his way, crawling, to bed.

This early morning, he is running a bit late. His head aches a little, and he had a bad stomach until he took an antacid with his first cup of tea.

But that isn’t why he’s so drained, so lethargic. He doesn’t think so, anyway. He barely knows if he’s slept. He thinks he was probably awake most of the night, tossing and turning, but he cannot be sure.

He feels, besides the hangover, a twisting inside him.

On impulse, because he’d spied it on the worktop, beneath another empty bottle, he had reached for the letter the Council had sent. Torn it open with a butter knife — unwashed and greasy — and squinted at the flickering words, trying hard to comprehend. It became clear, after a moment, that it wasn’t his pension statement. Their timing wasn’t as off as he’d thought.

It is scrunched up in his pocket now; balled inside his fist. He feels as though he wants to kick out at something, but has not yet found anything suitable to kick. Not yet.

But here he stands at the gates.

He unlocks them, passes through, and then locks them again. His shoes sink a little into the mud of the field; a mark of how much it had rained overnight. He squelches on, heedless. The trains are ahead of him, ten feet apart. Steam billows out from their engines and trails them, forming a wreath around most of the track.

A couple of yards short of that circuit, he stops. Looks down at the ground, as though in deep contemplation. As though, like Jemima, he’s busy preparing to make something up.

Even though, today, he doesn’t actually need to.

Even without closing his eyes, without saying its name three times, he can already see the white bulk of that building, the one that will surely be here within months. The bright, sterile lights that beam out through its windows, as big as regular houses. The ‘Special Offer’ signs posted behind all that glass. The masses of tourists that stream in beyond them. The rush and the bustle. The stray shopping trolleys. The car park, at least twice the size of this village, full of cars so much bigger than his Rolls and his Jag. The roadworks expanding and leading to here.

He doesn’t need magic to know this is coming.

But he takes a step into the ring, all the same. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Three For Hers
by Filip Hajdar Drnovšek Zorko
 

The second time one of Vida’s brothers came home with strips of flesh cut out of his back, she decided it was time for the Margrave’s rule to end.

‘Don’t go,’ her middle brother sobbed. His bandages had soaked through, blood clumping where it met the grimy floor. ‘I was brave and fierce, and it was not enough.’

‘Don’t go,’ her oldest brother pleaded. His back had scarred a long time ago. So had his spirit. ‘I was strong and stubborn, and it was not enough.’

‘Please don’t go.’ Her father’s face was the hardest to ignore. Vida bundled the last of her belongings. It did not take long: the Plemitschi allowed them only food and clothing.

‘We have served the rulers of this land since it was young.’ Vida looked down as she spoke. Her father remembered a time when their service had been freely given, one Yagichari to another. She did not wish to see that nostalgia on his face. ‘I will not stop now.’

‘I’ll go instead,’ her father said. ‘You cannot do this to your brothers. They rely on your good cheer. I cannot bear to see your heart harden in the Margrave’s service.’

Vida did not want to upset him. She did not say, My heart hardened the day the Plemitschi came. Or, My heart broke the day the plague broke out, and I have pretended ever since, for you and for my brothers, because I knew I was stronger. Or, There is no heart where the Plemitschi tread.

‘I will serve,’ Vida said, and left.


The shadow crept along the high street of Konj like a grasping hand. Two houses away, a body transport bobbed in front of a door marked with the red plague mosquito. A bad day. She could tell by how low in the air the transport lay. She hurried on. It was late—the Margrave’s castle-ship was positioned carefully to block the sun. The Plemitschi did not mind if their conquests woke to the play of sunlight through tattered curtains, so long as they went to bed in their masters’ shadow.

The castle-ship hung in the sky, tricking the eye like the painted backdrops Vida’s father made when she’d played at being an actor. There were turrets at each of its five corners. In direct sunlight, the eye was drawn to the nacre gleam sheathing their upper levels. On the day of the invasion, they’d unfurled delicate whorls, like leaves of bracken, and everything they touched died.

The mud was cold beneath Vida’s feet. Beauty was hard to find in Konj, but she knew where to look. She saw it in the yellow street-lamps, which had not yet been replaced with ones of Plemitschi make. She saw it in the battered sign that hung above the apothecary, the vine-wrapped pestle identifying the medical profession centuries after the tool itself had fallen out of use. She saw it in the mud. Mud persisted.

It took her ten minutes to walk the high street. The open patch of land beneath the castle-ship had been a graveyard—Vida remembered gravestones festooned with flowers and flickering candles on the day of remembrance. Now the gravestones were gone and directly beneath the castle-ship, at the point where an upwards glance was occluded entirely by its grey underside, a pair of the Margrave’s soldiers stood at attention.

‘Your business?’ one said.

The soldiers wore the masks of the Plemitschi military, full-face plates on which nauseating patterns swarmed and multiplied. She kept her gaze down, loathing her own deference. It was better than looking at the hallucination where a face should be. She could still smell the bitter ozone of the illusions.

I have come to serve, as my family has always served. Cool. Unaffected. An unyielding mask to counter their shifting ones—she’d thought it would be easy. Her throat constricted. Away from her family, she found she could not speak herself into servitude. She could not pretend that the counsel her ancestors once offered their leaders was in any way equivalent to how the Margrave used her family now, as trinkets to mark the respectability and continuity of his rule.

‘My brother was sent home today.’ It was a struggle to get even those words out. Vida breathed out through her nose, closed the shutters on her rage, and smiled. ‘I am here in his place.’

‘Today?’

Was this a mistake? Was it unusual for someone to come without a summons? When her brother had staggered in through the door, the conviction had burnt so strong it hadn’t occurred to her to wait. What use was a plan, compared to Plemitschi might? She was smart and quick and clever. Everyone said so. Instinct had told her to go without delay.

She put her misgivings away and said, ‘Yes.’

The guards verified her identity, checked her for weapons, then summoned the lift. The castle-ship could land—Vida had seen it, regurgitating military parades on the Plemitschi Day of Nationhood—but most of the time access was obtained through the lift, a platform five paces to a side cut from the castle-ship’s belly. It floated down to them in a display of technological superiority so unintentional, it whitened Vida’s knuckles around the lift’s railing.

‘Poor bastard,’ one of the guards said, and she spent the ascent trying to decide who they meant, her or her brother, and barely noticed when she passed into the Margrave’s bosom.

There was a woman waiting for her on the other end. She was short for a Plemitschi, her thick brown hair pinned close to her skull and her cheekbones set low on a face marked with the faint cross-hatching of a plague survivor. Were these typical Plemitschi features? Other than the Margrave, Vida had only ever seen them masked.

‘The Margrave wishes to greet you personally,’ the woman said. ‘Follow me.’

The castle-ship was disappointingly mundane. The doors they passed were furnished with control panels rather than handles, but otherwise the technology that made the lift work, that hid death within the ship’s five shining towers, was nowhere in evidence.

‘Who are you?’ Vida said, to give her ears something to hear.

The woman slowed her pace to match Vida’s. ‘My name is Orzsa. I am the ship’s administrator.’

‘Does that mean you can make it fly?’ She did not ask as a potential saboteur, only as a child who had been promised and denied something wondrous.

‘No. Only the Margrave has access to the ship’s higher functions. He has automated most of those, in order to devote more time to his passions. I have authority over the administrative systems only.’

Which systems, Vida did not dare ask. Instead, she gestured at the corridor curving away to her right. ‘It’s emptier than I thought it would be.’

‘The garrison is housed separately.’

‘I meant—I thought there would be others. From the town. I’ve heard—’ Vida reconsidered. Better not to repeat the stories the townspeople told of the Margrave.

‘There were many. Most found the Margrave’s service too…demanding. The Margrave does not force anyone to serve.’ Orzsa’s smile contained an acknowledgement of the unspoken: anyone except you.

Having her questions answered made Vida bolder. ‘And you? Do you find his service demanding?’

Orzsa stopped in front of a door set, unlike the others, in the inner wall of the corridor. ‘The Margrave is not cruel to those who follow his rules. Be polite. Be deferential.’

The door opened onto a garden.

From the outside, it was hidden entirely from sight, nestled in amongst the five towers. A glass dome rose above them, catching sunlight, transforming the interior of the ship into a peaceful day in the woods—but this was not the most remarkable thing about the garden.

The most remarkable thing were the plants. Ever since the invasion, the soil of Konj had strained to produce anything worth growing, but here, inside, the garden was carpeted in lush blue-green grass; birch trees rose gracefully at the far end, their tops brushing the artificial sky; snowdrops grew wild among their roots and roses in neat flowerbeds.

‘Gardening is one of the Margrave’s passions,’ Orzsa said, as if the whole impossible garden were nothing but a hobbyist’s allotment. ‘This way.’

Vida wondered how deep the soil went. She wanted to look around and smell things she hadn’t smelled since childhood. She wanted to take off her shoes. She did not want to approach the man standing by the flowerbeds in a black satin morning coat fastened with silver buttons.

‘My lord Margrave,’ Orzsa said, bowing. ‘The family of the chief advisor offers its daughter.’

The Margrave was, in Vida’s mind, the face of the Plemitschi: tall and pale and slender, black hair cut short, dark eyes about a whipcord nose, a face better suited to being seen from afar. His nails were painted pale red.

‘Already? It was only this morning that your dear brother left us! A shame, but it does warm my heart to see such a loyal sister. Tell me: what is your name?’

‘Vida.’

‘Ah! Like the song!’ The Margrave winked, as if his knowledge of Yagichari folk music proved some deep connection between them. ‘Welcome. You are from Konj? Such a relief. I had a boy from the outlying villages once, but I only see them once a year. I simply could not connect with him! Konj is different. It is close to my heart.’

Vida remembered watching from her father’s shoulders, the first time the Margrave embarked on his annual procession. She remembered the tension that followed: relief at his absence; guilt at knowing his gaze had fallen on friends and relatives beyond the borders of Konj. She remembered the Harvest Riot, three days later upon his return.

‘My lord,’ Vida said. ‘My brothers have twice failed you. I will do better.’

‘I’m glad to hear it! I doubt a bright young thing like you will have trouble. I don’t ask for much. Do as I say. Complete the tasks I set you. And—I’m sure you’ve heard, but I must go through the motions, yes? There is a rule I have, one I care about very much. It is a special rule, because it applies to me, too. I cannot abide anger. Not in myself, not in others. This is paramount. If you ever lose your temper in my presence, you will leave my service immediately, less three strips of flesh off your own back. Do you agree to these terms?’

He smiled widely, inviting her to join him in pretending she had a choice. ‘I do,’ she said.

Vida knew what was coming next: a blow to the face, backhanded, to test the strength of the Margrave’s rule. She’d heard the story, whispered by those who chanced the Margrave’s service. Her brothers spoke of the unexpected whiplash strength in the Margrave’s long arms. Endure, they said. Take the blow. Hide your rage.

Vida struck the Margrave clean across the nose with the palm of her hand. He staggered back a step. When he righted himself, there was a trickle of blood on his upper lip.

‘Now,’ he said at length. ‘What was that, I wonder?’

Vida looked down. ‘Apologies, my lord. I thought I saw a mosquito upon your nose. I would hate to see plague take you.’ She shifted her weight from one foot to the other. ‘I do hope I haven’t made you angry, my lord?’

The Margrave took his time studying her. Vida stood her ground and swam in her anger, immersed herself so thoroughly that not a hint of it appeared on her face. She would prevail where her brothers had not.

Presently the Margrave said, ‘Plemitschi are immune to the plague. But I won’t hold your ignorance against you. If I did that, I would go through servants even faster than I already do! Orzsa, take her to her quarters.’

A hand on Vida’s shoulder propelled her away from the Margrave. ‘That was a mistake,’ Orzsa murmured. ‘He will be watching you now.’

Vida did not say, Good. Or, Then he will be watching on the day he dies. Or, He will watch me until the point of his own knife pierces his cornea and his eye drains of its fluid.

She said, ‘Good-night.’

‘The Margrave has a task for you.’

Vida washed sleep from her face. She combed her fingers through her hair and swept it back behind her shoulders. Only then did she turn to Orzsa, who stood by the door. ‘Yes?’

‘He is in the mood for a new bed of flowers. You will take these seeds to the garden and plant them. Once you are done you may report to the mess.’

‘Flowers,’ Vida said, accepting the small sack. It was made of a smooth white material as alien to her as she knew the seeds within would be.

‘The soil is poor in these parts, but much can be done with the application of Plemitschi technology,’ Orzsa said, as if she were not herself Plemitschi.

‘That’s all? One flowerbed?’ Vida took her shifts at planting and harvest, as everyone in Konj did, working longer hours each passing year for less reward. ‘I was expecting… more.’

‘That depends. If you are another downtrodden soul for the Margrave to break at his leisure, then that is all.’ Orzsa hesitated, then extended two long fingers, as if offering up something delicate. ‘But if you are equal to your display last night, then perhaps there is more. Perhaps you should not do as I say. Perhaps you should leave those seeds here, and instead climb the turrets, and feel the wind on your face.’

Was this a warning? An offer of help? Vida’s instincts prevailed. Orzsa was Plemitschi. There would be no alliance from that quarter, only tricks and tests.

Vida said, ‘And incur the Margrave’s wrath?’

Orzsa flinched. Her hand returned to her side. ‘Never that. His punishment, yes, but never his wrath. The rule applies to us all.’

‘My mistake,’ Vida said. ‘As it would be my mistake to follow your advice. I will do as the Margrave orders.’

‘In that case,’ Orzsa said, her expression once again smoothed into blank Plemitschi superiority, ‘you would do well not to linger.’

The soil in the Margrave’s garden was dark and loamy, fragrant with the scent of new growth. Nothing like the dull, sour fields Vida was used to. It was slow going—the seeds were small black things, but Orzsa insisted it was imperative to plant each one individually—and more satisfying for it.

‘You’re almost done?’

Vida straightened and stretched away the aches of a morning’s work. The ceiling caught the heat of the sun but left the chill autumn air outside, and she’d taken her shirt off as she worked. Now, Orzsa’s shadow crossing hers, she wished she were not so relaxed. ‘Yes.’

‘Unfortunate,’ Orzsa said. ‘I made an error. Those were the wrong seeds. You’ll have to take them out and start again.’

‘Take them out?’ The simple joy of working the earth curdled in Vida’s breast. ‘How am I supposed to find them? They’re the same colour as the soil!’

‘You will have to be meticulous.’ Orzsa’s smile made her look almost human. ‘It’s a shame. The day is clear. You would have been able to see for miles in every direction.’

‘What are you—’ The question died on her lips. Perhaps you should climb the turrets. ‘Another test,’ she snapped. ‘That’s all this was?’

‘Mind your temper. Everything is a test with the Margrave.’

Vida checked herself. She loved her brothers, but they lost their tempers as easily as they forgave. She’d thought herself different, not understanding how easily a mask could crack under unfamiliar pressures, how quickly the thought of barren fields would turn to rage with the grit of fertile soil beneath her nails.

‘Good,’ Orzsa said. ‘You may eat once you are done.’

‘Then I will be lucky to eat at all today.’

The flash of guilt Vida expected did not materialise. ‘Everything is a test,’ Orzsa repeated. ‘The only question is whether you are meant to pass or fail.’

‘Which was this?’

‘Better people than you have driven themselves mad asking that question.’

Vida surged to her feet, remembered herself in time, injected calm into her voice. ‘What does a Plemitschi know of good people?’

Orzsa considered her with calm, grey eyes, and for the first time Vida wondered what sort of person might be forged in a crucible that forbade the use of anger. Orzsa turned and pulled her shirt over her head with languid movements. Vida cursed. Fresh welts stood out from Orzsa’s back like ridges denuded in a storm. The hem of her trousers was stained russet where the largest welts had oozed trails of blood.

‘Do you know what the Margrave does with the strips of flesh he claims from his victims?’ Orzsa replaced her shirt without wincing. ‘He tans them. Then he turns them into whips. Flaying he reserves for those who break his cardinal rule. Flogging is for lesser failures. In this way the smaller punishment contains the greater.’

Vida wanted desperately to look away. ‘But why did he—’

‘Vida.’ Orzsa sounded like a teacher dealing with a student who refused to understand a simple concept. ‘Who gave you the incorrect seeds this morning?’

Vida neither ate nor slept that night. If Orzsa had intended to warn her, why not give her the right seeds to begin with? Had it been caution on Orzsa’s part, a potential ally unwilling to expose herself? Or another move in the Margrave’s game?

The uncertainty unmoored her. She made anchors of the Margrave’s cardinal rule: Do not show anger. You will get better. You will hide yourself. It was a comforting thought. She did not think it was true.

Orzsa delivered the Margrave’s instructions at dawn. Menial work: prune the hedges; launder, with a sharp-smelling, chalky liquid Vida had never seen before; synchronise the ship calendars with the limited access Orzsa granted her. Instead of the relief of no longer having his attention upon her, Vida felt slighted, as if the Margrave had declared her a poor opponent after all. She approached every task cautiously, fearing the hidden barb in it.

The catch came when she stopped expecting it, halfway down the corridor that led back to her quarters after dinner.

‘Vida.’

The Margrave’s voice tugged at her with the unsettling sensation of a broken nail caught in coarse cloth. Vida turned, cursing herself—she’d walked right past him!—but no, it wasn’t her fault. There he was, emerging from a door that had been shut. She could see racks of Plemitschi shock-wands behind him, just three of which had quelled the Harvest Riot, and concentrated instead on the dance of the Margrave’s long fingers as he locked the armoury behind him.

‘May I assist, my lord?’

‘I was impressed by your tenacity last night. I trust Orzsa’s little error didn’t put you out of too much sleep!’

‘Not at all, my lord.’

‘Good.’ The Margrave smiled like a fisherwoman sensing the bite. ‘Then you won’t mind staying out again tonight? The task I have in mind requires a certain amount of spirit.’

Vida saw the trap too late. How could she refuse, when she had just professed herself well-rested? She waited for anger and the end, but she was too exhausted to feel anything. ‘Of course, my lord.’

‘Excellent. I have a couple casks of Plemitschi honey wine on the roof of the front-right turret—do you know it? No? A very delicate wine. It requires bright sunlight and clear air to age properly—and, between you and me, the air down at ground level is too fetid.’ He wrinkled his nose ostentatiously. ‘A glass of honey wine in the middle of all this squalor—it keeps me on my feet. But lately I have noticed the level dropping. I’d sooner believe birds have learnt to tap the casks, but if someone in the castle is to blame… you’ll understand, won’t you, if I’d like some peace of mind. Ascend the tower. Prove my mind is playing tricks on me. If you keep watch all night, I know it would set my fears to rest.’

The only words Vida truly heard were keep watch all night. ‘Of course, my lord,’ she repeated mechanically.

‘I knew you’d be up to it. I will instruct the guards to let you up.’

Vida waited in the middle of the corridor until his footsteps faded. His plan was obvious, in hindsight. She would fall asleep, and the “thieves”—operating on the Margrave’s own orders, no doubt—would do their work. She would fail. She would be punished. Would she rail at the injustice? Would she break the Margrave’s rule, paying the cost willingly if it meant returning home? Would she pass the baton to her father?

She would not. The thought of her father steadied her. Her fingers were deft and sure on the control panel by the armoury door, inputting the same code she’d watched the Margrave use to lock it. The door opened and the breadth of the Plemitschi arsenal was available to her, had she but the strength to wield it. Then she saw the reason for the Margrave’s presence: in one corner, on racks of polished hardwood, sat the Margrave’s collection of whips. She did not look too closely. She did not want to see if any had freshly added tails. She did not want to know if any part of those weapons was made of her brothers.

Any desire to wield the shock-wands of the Plemitschi legions fell away. What good were they? She could barely muster the strength to save herself. When she sealed the door shut again, all she carried was a single spool of stun-wire.

Vida woke to the distant call of a cockerel. Her back was stiff but her mind clear, the previous night’s memories presenting themselves readily. She was at the top of a tower. One of the precious casks of honey-wine served as a pillow, and the stun-wire—

Vida’s eyes shot open. There were two bodies slumped by the stairs. The stun-wire, near invisible when she’d teased it out in a circle around the casks, stood out against the brilliant white rooftop now that it had burnt out. Vida had seen stun-wire deployed by the Plemitschi often enough to imagine the scene: one thief tripping the wire, the other too close behind to avoid stumbling, the both of them collapsed, twitching.

Vida got to her feet, gritting her teeth through the complaints of deadened muscle. She’d passed the test. Now all she needed to do was confirm the thieves’ identities and report them to the Margrave.

They wore the masks of Plemitschi soldiers. It took her the better part of a minute to unfasten the first. The face thus revealed, its motion locked away by stun-wire, was Orzsa’s. Something acrid and bitter filled the back of her throat: the taste of an emotion she should not be feeling at the sight of a Plemitschi laid low. She couldn’t bear to remain on the rooftop. Her feet beat the rhythm of words out on the steps: It doesn’t matter. She’s the same as the others—it doesn’t matter that it was her.

The Margrave was waiting for her at the base of the stairs. ‘Well?’

Briefly she considered lying. But what was the point? The bodies were there. They would be found whether she told him or not. ‘You were right, my lord.’ She swallowed guilt. Her next words came smoothly. ‘There were two of them. I overpowered them.’ And would that bring him down upon her? She’d left the stun-wire where it was. It doesn’t matter. ‘They’re still up on the roof.’

The Margrave searched her face for signs of—what? Whatever he did or did not see in her, it seemed to satisfy him. ‘Excellent. Why don’t you take the day off? You must be exhausted.’

Vida could hardly tell him she’d spent the night asleep. She said, ‘Yes, my lord.’

The day passed with now-familiar anxiety. When the knock came, late in the evening, Vida was expecting it. She was learning. The Margrave liked to blind his victim with boredom before the blow. This time, she was ready for it.

She was not ready for Orzsa’s face at the door, hands clasped demurely but wracked with the after-spasms of the stun-wire. ‘The Margrave has finished questioning the thief. He would have you present for his judgement.’

‘But you were— There were two thieves.’

‘There was one thief. If you would follow me?’

‘Wait!’ There were things Vida wanted to say that could not be said in the open, and this room was all the sanctuary she had. ‘Why do you serve him? He abuses you, too. You’re bound by the same rules.’

Orzsa tilted her head, as if measuring out exactly how far to take her words. ‘Because I have seen your type before. You are clever. Quick on your feet. You think that is all it takes to undo the Margrave. But it was not enough for any of those others.’

‘And your solution is to never act at all!’

‘Mind your temper.’

‘I won’t! You tried to warn me, the first day. What happened?’

‘You did not heed my warning.’

‘Then help me now! Unless you don’t really care. Maybe you pretend you’re not Plemitschi at all, to make yourself feel better!’

‘Look at my face.’

The instruction was too bizarre to ignore. Vida studied the lines of Orzsa’s face, the cold blankness of it, the faint red plague threads shading her cheeks and chin. ‘Oh. But—he said you were immune.’

‘He said he was immune.’ Orzsa’s voice, always even, had now the potential energy of a boulder balanced atop a spire. ‘Perhaps you have it backwards. Perhaps I pretend I am a Plemitschi because it is easier to think I was never anything else.’

Threatened with shame, Vida turned back to rage. ‘But what is the point? Do you even know how anger feels, after years of him?’

‘Better than you think. I know that you cannot beat the Margrave at his own game.’

‘Then what did I do last night?’

Orzsa tore a ragged laugh from her throat. ‘I am glad to have known you, Vida. I forgive you. And I am sorry.’

‘For what?’

‘Come. Let us go and see what you did last night.’

The Margrave dispensed justice in the glory of his power, when the last rays of the setting sun lit his throne like a flower curled around a bee.

‘Vida!’ It was as if the throne room were made to hold his voice, to bounce it lovingly within the vault of its ceiling. ‘You did well. I would not want you to miss the best part.’

Someone was kneeling in the middle of the room, facing away from the throne. At the Margrave’s signal, Orzsa approached and drew back the cloth bag around the man’s head.

Vida’s first thought was a stab of simple concern: her father’s face looked drawn. Had he been getting enough sleep? The question cushioned her from the others: how could he be here—what would happen to him—how could she have let the Margrave win? No—that was the wrong word. Victory implied competition. If she’d failed to stop the thieves, the punishment would have come down on her instead. It was not victory. It was inevitability.

When the Margrave stood, Vida was re-learning her father’s face. When he descended the steps from his throne, she was returning her father’s perforated smile. And when he drew the knife at his belt, when its thrice-folded steel sung a greeting to the air, she could not turn away from her father’s innocence. A blessing, she thought, that she could not see the Margrave work—but then her father’s expression turned wrong, as if all the muscles of his face had tightened perpendicular to a smile, and she could track the Margrave’s progress by the pain chiselled from her father’s features.

When the Margrave was done, he leaned down and cleaned his blade on the front of her father’s shirt. Three strips of flesh hung from his hand like a brace of pheasants from a hunter’s. He studied them, wrapped them around his knuckles, then cast them aside to slap wetly on the floor.

He said, ‘I thought you would enjoy seeing the seeds of justice bloom. I do hope you’re not upset?’

Vida’s instincts warred within her, to run or to fight or to weep. She wanted to take his knife and carve the smile right off his face. What was left to lose? She’d failed to protect her family. The Margrave’s eyes shone with the triumph of bringing someone to their breaking point.

She would prove him right. She would take his triumph and impale it on the broken shards of herself.

Behind him, flanking the throne, Orzsa slowly shook her head.

And Vida understood. She could never be the woman she’d imagined herself being, cool and unflappable and waiting for her moment. Three days in the castle-ship had proved it. But Orzsa already was that woman. They were not opposite but complementary—a Yagichari who was too quick to act, and a woman who had not always been Plemitschi, who risked never acting at all.

And here Orzsa was, expecting Vida to burn out as every other person in the Margrave’s employ had, but imploring her to inaction all the same.

That act of solidarity saved Vida’s life.

‘Of course not.’ Her voice sounded different. Like Orzsa’s. ‘I’m grateful for the privilege.’

‘You have done well, Vida.’ The Margrave’s voice made a collar of her name. ‘Enjoy your evening. I expect to see you hard at work in the morning.’

Vida ignored the thing on the floor that was not, could not be, her father’s weeping, bleeding body. She said, ‘Good evening, my lord,’ and walked away.

Orzsa came to her in the middle of the night.

Vida’s revelation had been mutual. Orzsa recognised herself in the brittle composure Vida had shown in the throne room. Now she said, I was wrong about you. And, There is something of me in you. And, Let me show you the part of you in me.

Together, they made their plan.

A week later, the Margrave prepared to depart on his annual procession through his holdings.

The castle-ship descended. Its front fell open like a drawbridge, exposing its vast belly to the open air. Inside, the garrison was forming up, five columns of infantry around a sleek hover-transport. It was an ugly thing in red and black, open-topped—the perfect foil for the Margrave’s parade uniform, which garment he was now completing with a pair of gloves so bright Vida wondered if they had been white before they were red.

‘Three days!’ The Margrave was in a buoyant mood. He had been, often, since breaking Vida. ‘Be sure to leave a light burning, eh? Ha!’

Vida watched the procession leave. The revelry would come upon its return, celebrating the Day of Plemitschi Nationhood. Before the invasion, it had been the harvest festival. That notion had been excised from Yagichari minds on the day of the Harvest Riot.

A few hours after the Margrave’s departure, the castle-ship descended once again. It lay like a beast shedding heat after a meal, maw open, loyally awaiting masters still days away.

Vida made her way to the armoury with Orzsa’s access codes. She had time. Even if word reached him immediately, the Margrave would be hours returning. Time to browse the death collected there and select the instrument with which she would fulfil the Margrave’s request. Time to take the shock-wand to the Margrave’s garden and set the trees alight. Time to imagine flames reflecting off his ivory towers.

She waited in the place that was still a cemetery despite the lack of headstones. Her people trickled outside, the intrepid leading the meek. She watched them filter into the castle-ship, where Orzsa waited to direct them to armoury. She carefully did not think about the fates of the castle-ship’s remaining defenders.

The Margrave arrived one hour later, ahead of schedule, his hover-transport caked with grime. His honour guard must have been left far behind. Vida wondered what he expected to find. Something other than her, sitting on a dusty railing, watching the smoke snake lazily on the wind. The castle-ship, ignited by a tragic accident? The people of Konj, loyally fighting the blaze?

‘What,’ he said, upon discovering this was not the case, ‘have you done?’

‘Left a light burning,’ Vida said. She felt like she was on stage, the hazy lights of the theatre penetrating the smoke only weakly.

‘You fool,’ the Margrave began.

Vida did not listen to the rest of his assessment. Oh, she thought as spittle ran down his chin. How strange. He does not understand. He thinks we are still playing his game.

‘You will tell me who did this.’ The Margrave punctuated his conclusion with a finger directed to her forehead. ‘Then we will consider your punishment.’

‘I did.’

His expression would keep her warm through winter. ‘You? Impossible. Only I can command the ship to descend.’

‘Orzsa helped,’ Vida said, magnanimously.

‘You will tell me who did this. Orzsa does not have the authority!’

‘No,’ Vida agreed, ‘but it was already programmed to descend, three days from now. And she does have the authority to set the ship’s time and date. Doesn’t that mean you did this? You were the one who automated so many of the ship’s systems, weren’t you?’

The Margrave did not speak, but his gaze was as colourful as his words were not.

‘Margrave.’ The word passed like poisoned honey, blistering her lips. ‘You’re not angry, are you?’

The Margrave snarled, lunged forwards—and fell to the ground, face-down, as if someone had slid the bones right out of his limbs. The stun-wire sparked and went silent. His beautiful, terrible knife was at its customary place on his belt. He twitched but did not resist when she reached for it. The blade came out smooth; the handle fit her hand like a noose fit a neck. It felt unreal.

‘You can’t—’ His voice was slurred. ‘I am a Margrave of the Plemitschi, and the Treaty of Bech protects me from—’

The only thing protecting him from her was the proud black-and-red of his uniform, torn through one shoulder, gaudy like an actor’s costume. He flinched at the sound of it coming apart down his back.

‘I can.’

The knife parted his skin as easily as it had parted her brothers’. The muscles in his shoulders bunched, heaved, but there was Vida, pushing them down, there was the blade, sliding in along the bone like a ship come into harbour, severing his resistance. She made a game of it: every time he twitched, she cut.

Three strips. That was the punishment. Everyone knew someone with the scars on their back to prove it. The third time her knife came up for air, he sobbed with relief. Three strips: he was free.

Vida regarded his butchered back. She began to laugh, then to cry. Three for his anger—

And three for hers. Three for her brothers, for Orzsa, for rules he had no right to make; three for the plague transports, three for the shadow along Konj’s streets, three, three, three until the blade snapped in half, three until his heart saw the light, three until there was nothing left to cut. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> The Healer of Branford
by C. A. Barrett
After twenty years, Maud decided that it was safe to return to her hometown. She had never personally known a cat to live to the age of twenty, and even if someone had taken one inside and cosseted it into old age it would be too feeble to recognize her now. So Maud tied a scarf over her aching face and found a straight walking-stick. She went up to Branford by the old cobbled road. Her path rose alongside ample hills of heath spangled with flowers, bright purple and yellow reminders of the magic flowing underneath the soil. She saw a distant flock of birds wheeling in the air, and felt just as light. Branford, City of Magic-on-the-Moor, would be home again. Branford would take away her pain.

She was almost at the city gate when a small orange tabby-cat sprang up from his napping. He leaped to the top of a hitching-post and stared at her, blinked twice, then cried out “Maud Coffand! Maud Coffand, the cats know what you did!”

“I am not Maud Coffand,” she said, passing him. Maud pulled her scarf a little tighter around her face.

“Then take off that scarf and show me your mouth,” said the cat. When Maud did not reply he hopped down and darted ahead of her. As they walked through the gate, the cat wove through the crowd’s feet, prancing with his tail straight and tall. “Maud Coffand! Maud Coffand has returned!” he called. Small cat-faces appeared in the corners of windows and from underneath stairs. By the time Maud entered Branford’s walls their eyes tracked her from every direction, glittering in the shadows like the vermin they were.

“Leave me alone,” she said to the cat.

“Did you think we’d forgotten? Did you think you could sneak in?” the tabby replied, slowing and nearly tripping them both as he turned his head. “We’ve told every kitten born here about you, Maud Coffand.”

Maud looked around to make sure that no one was paying attention to the cat’s meowing, then leaned over him. “Leave me alone for today, and then I’ll go away again.”

“You’ve come for just today? Oh, oh! You’ve come to see the Healer!” The cat relished this information, scrunching his nose as if swallowing a morsel.

“Go!” Maud swung her walking-stick at the cat violently.

It sprang away, out of reach. “Maud Coffand wants to see the Healer! Do you really think the Healer will heal you, Maud Coffand?”

Maud stopped and lifted her foot. She grabbed her shoe by the heel, pulled it off, and threw it at the cat as hard as she could.

She missed, but the cat still ran away, calling out “Maud Coffand!” as he went.

Maud had to hobble forward and stoop to retrieve her shoe, leaning on her walking-stick. Some of the cat faces pulled back into their nooks, but she still felt their eyes on her, joined by the gazes of curious humans as the flow of travelers broke around her. She awkwardly pulled on her shoe. Maud put the walking-stick under her arm and clutched the scarf to her face, fingers tracing hard ridges under the cloth. She dare not let it slip. There were no birds when she looked up, but she did see two cats on windowsills, sitting like loaves with their feet and legs tucked under. The cats watched her but made no move to stand as she rejoined the foot-traffic down the street.

Branford was more crowded than Maud had ever known, but she had left long before the Healer of Branford began seeing patients. She had heard that the woman opened the doors of her house just once a week, and took only one person inside. The streets were thick with people, and Maud saw competition for the coveted spot: here a knot of children gathered protectively around a slow-walking man with crutches, and there two parents shepherded a girl in bandages stinking of pestilence. But most of the crowd in Branford, City of Magic-on-the-Moor, were here for other business or other pleasures and moved down the street without the grim determination of the ill. The crowd was compressed in a narrowed path because a carnival of fake fortune-tellers and cheap trinket-sellers were out to prey on it. Colored scarves and banners hung over the cobblestones, and striped awnings covered stalls on both sides.

Maud slipped in close to a stall stacked with familiar goods: toy-sized wooden pails, each paired with a red knit ball, small clay cups with glazed red beads stuck to them, and scarves embroidered with brown rectangles and red dots. Red berries in a bucket, everywhere she turned. These trinkets had no power but sold steadily because every family that knew the legends of Branford made plans to bring their daughters to its Wishing Well, and bought her a promise. Maud could pick out the families here for the Well today. She saw several young girls at the cusp of adulthood surrounded by a cloud of relatives, all of them dressed in finery. It was customary to wear a new yellow dress and put flowers in your hair when you visited the Well because of a popular but cloying poem that Maud despised. It certainly added pageantry to what was otherwise an ugly neighborhood water cistern. The maidens would smile at their parents as they lifted the round wooden lid and lowered the oak-wood bucket. The poem and the older legends said that if a girl was deemed worthy of magic gifts, then a bright red berry would be bobbing in the water when the bucket was drawn up. Name your heart’s desire before you ate it, and it would be granted, but choose carefully, because no one had ever been given more than a single berry. The out-of-town girls who clustered around the well every day called out for good husbands and rosy cheeks while still pulling on the rope. They laughed when the bucket held only water, then went to celebrate their maturity by eating roast duck and shopping for silk before going home.

Branford’s native daughters came to the well in quiet twilight moments, without any of that nonsense. Twenty years before, Maud had dipped the bucket and drawn it up. And when Maud bit into her berry, she wished for the power to kill cats.

Looking over the trinkets, Maud touched the scarf on her face, rubbed the painful lumps under it, and checked its knot again.

“Maud Coffand!” the orange tabby-cat cried. He appeared from behind the stall, hopping up onto it and landing between the buckets and toys.

“Stop following me,” she said.

“We know what you did, Maud Coffand!”

“Then you know that I can do it again, you nasty little killer,” she said, leaning forward and pulling down her scarf to reveal the gleaming tips of her teeth to the cat alone. The lower ones were so long that they touched her nostrils now. Maud’s teeth had become sharp and pointed as soon as the berry burst between them, and at first she was delighted with her power. Never again would a songbird in Branford die without being avenged. She stalked the shadows and pounced on every cat crouched over a small still body. Their meat tasted sweet to her. She hunted the cats who had not yet hurt birds, but would if left to grow. She watered the grave of every sparrow with the blood of cats, and her teeth grew a tiny bit longer with every bite.

The cats of Branford, twenty years ago, had lost their ears and tails and limbs and lives, and Maud’s teeth gained three rows and distended her lips and jaw as they lengthened. She frequently bit her own tongue and drooled blood, but she was never clumsy when landing the killing bite on a cat, and she was drawing closer to the orange tabby now. “Speak again. I can clean this town of cats before I go.”

“I do not want to ask about cats, Maud Coffand.” The tabby’s ears were flat behind his striped head and his black pupils had widened so they filled his eyes. His tail was puffed and lashing, but it did not knock over a single toy, and he did not back away. “I want to hear about the child.”

Maud swung her walking stick over her head and brought it down where the cat was sitting, breaking the little stall in two. The fabric awning was caught by the end of the stick and tore as buckets toppled to the ground, spilling their cloth berries into the mud. The cat dodged and jumped free, unscathed. The man selling toys shouted and lunged for Maud. He seized the end of her stick and she abandoned it, running into the crowd with both her hands over her scarf.

She hated the child even more than she hated the cats. The child chose to pull at that kitten in her teeth when Maud was out biting. The child put herself in Maud’s mouth. And the child made Maud a fugitive. Whenever she thought about that night, Maud could feel her teeth scraping against a small human skull. She could feel the red hairs stuck between her teeth after, even though she spat the mouthful of scalp to the ground before running, just like this, through the streets.

As on that long-ago night, Maud knew Branford well enough to twist between the short roads and escape pursuit. She stopped on a dead-end street not far from the Well and leaned against a brick wall. There she ducked her head down and checked her scarf. She took large breaths until her lungs stopped burning, but the sharp pain awoken in her jaw did not subside. It was the child’s blood that had made her molars grow until her jaw was nearly unhinged and she could barely eat or sleep. Sometimes she thought the mere memory of that night made them grow a little more.

Maud lifted her head and studied the crowd, noting the direction people walked. The sick supplicants were going this way, in their slow groups. She could move faster because she was alone. She would follow them to the healer’s house, slip between them to get close to the door, and jump through it when it opened. She had been carrying her pain longer than any of them and deserved to be healed more. And when her teeth no longer hurt, she would leave Branford forever. Resolved, Maud started to walk.

The Healer’s house was one of a modest row belonging to merchants and craftsmen, all tight as books on a shelf. The crowd thickened around its yellow door, only holding back from stepping on the door-mat itself. There were murmurs of “noon” in the happy chatter and many shaded eyes looked up at the sun, which was not quite overhead. Maud squeezed forward, pushing on elbows and backs. She felt something brush against her ankle, but when she looked down she saw only paving stones.

Maud stepped right onto the door-mat and knocked forcefully.

The crowd went silent. Maud knocked again, and she turned around to glare over her scarf at anyone who had shifted on their feet with thoughts of stepping forward to correct her. She raised her fist to knock a third time, but the door had already begun to open.

The man who stepped out was thin and tall. He faced the crowd and lifted his arm high, then pulled back his sleeve to show a sallow healing burn with the peeling layers freshly scrubbed away. From the cheers Maud surmised that it looked better than it had last week. The man moved into the crowd, and a woman with a small boy on her hip ran forward to embrace him with her free arm.

When Maud turned back to the doorway a woman stood in it, her braid of red hair thrown over one shoulder and near enough for Maud to touch. She was wearing a thick white canvas apron over her dress. The crowd spotted her and called out begging, all shouting their stories in a cacophony. The woman looked over them and as she turned her head Maud saw the scar: the far side of this younger woman’s face was a raw, pale quarry where muscle had been scraped away from cheek to the pit where an ear should be. The braid was one-sided because her red hair only began at the top of the scar: the scalp was missing from half her head. The taunt skin pulled down a watering eye that now met Maud’s, gazes that had last joined as they struggled over the body of a small gray kitten.

In that frozen moment, the orange tabby landed on Maud’s shoulder heavily, claws finding their mark through clothing and into flesh to secure his perch. The cat ripped Maud’s scarf away and then launched himself off, leaving fresh claw pains above her breast. He ran away with her covering.

The Healer of Branford raised her arm and pointed at Maud Coffand.

Maud reared back, knocking down the woman standing behind her, and then shoved the mother’s child down on top of her. She pushed away a grabbing hand and when a finger pointed at her mouth, she bit it. She sprinted away from the screams as her cursed teeth drank in blood and swelled again, pressing so tightly that they twisted together, locking her jaw.

The Healer was not Maud’s only plan in Branford. Maud ran toward the Wishing Well. When she got to its street Maud ran through the frivolous girls, scattering them from their perches on benches and stairs like a predator landing among pigeons, and snatched the bucket from its holder. She threw the bucket down the Well and it vanished from sight long before Maud heard a splash.

She pulled up the long rope handfuls at a time. The shouting was getting closer, as were the girls’ fathers, who unlike the mothers would not limit themselves to exclaiming aloud about her rudeness. Maud knew that she was about to be seized, but she reached the bucket first. She nearly toppled into the well grabbing it, flinging out an arm out to brace herself on the opposite side of the cistern.

The bucket held only clear water. No berry.

Maud scrambled over the rim of the well. The berries had to come from somewhere. She jumped, the fall ripping her skirts out of hands that tried to save her.

She fell for long enough to regret jumping and fear the landing.

When Maud hit water it provided no cushion. She fell through the water onto stone and landed on one leg. It snapped and twisted beneath her. Maud’s gasp filled her lungs with fluid before the current pulled her down and she went under the water on her side, into darkness. Her face hit hard rocks, teeth shattering in her cheek. Maud clawed at the walls, fighting the current’s flow. She felt the brickwork give way to rougher walls and hooked her raw fingers into the ledge where bricks ended. Pulling herself up, she found a pocket of air.

Maud gasped and coughed deeply, forcing water through her broken teeth. She shook water from her eyes without taking her hands from their holds. In the darkness she reached up and felt the wooden twist of some root. She gripped it and heaved her body from the lapping water. There was room to crawl here, though she could not see, and Maud followed the growth. Where she pulled on it, dirt cracked above and tiny beams of light broke through the ceiling of earth. This was not a root, but a vine, and in the distance Maud saw dangling berries. She scrambled eagerly, dragging her leg behind her. The berries did not look bright and red here in the dark. They were only dim brown shadows.

Maud wished for her teeth to be gone, and she reached out a hand.

The berry broke into dust at her touch. She grabbed another, but it was also a husk, as was the next. One by one she crushed the empty shells. Then she doubled over and cried, sobbing through rows of teeth she could not open. Maud was alone and without a single plan in her head left for company. She had been forced out of Branford a second time by the same person, and she lay there hating the girl. She imagined the red hair wrapping around her teeth again as she tore flesh with her mouth until the skull was clean and bare. Maud felt her own blood running down her chin and the sharp pulse of pain in her leg.

Soil fell onto her head. Above her the vine-tangled ground burst and a paw reached between the roots. It patted the empty air and withdrew, leaving a shaft of light that was immediately shadowed by frenzied digging. The orange tabby-cat squeezed through his new hole and dropped down beside Maud. She raised a hand to push him away, and the cat ignored it.

“There you are, Maud Coffand!” said the tabby-cat. He sounded enormously pleased with himself. As she rolled over onto her back the cat climbed onto her chest and stood with his feet pressing hard on her collarbone. He leaned forward and put his nose to the corner of her lips, sniffing loudly, exhaling stinking breath in her face. Maud tried to nip him, but her broken teeth shifted with the motion and stabbed her own exposed nerves. The cat’s cold nose forced itself into Maud’s lips, and he grabbed a long piece of tooth and pulled it out. She shoved him off, but could hear him beside her in the darkness, tonguing his prize clean. He returned and pulled out another fragment, and when she did not push him again he settled himself on her chest, breastbone to breastbone, purring as he chewed it. She could feel the vibrations in her heart. A second cat, and then a third, arrived from somewhere beyond Maud’s sight. She felt one at her arm and one at her hip, each taking up the purr. The tabby-cat threw them down pieces of tooth, and the cats all lapped at the red flesh on the white shards.

Maud moved her tongue through its new sharp-edged landscape and spoke, her voice muffled and careful but not gentle. “Why are you following me?”

“Let us trade answers,” said the tabby-cat. “Why do you hate us?”

“I do not hate you. I love songbirds.” Maud said.

“You have not kept yourself busy with songbirds, Maud Coffand.”

“Yes, I have,” said Maud. In her fervor she forgot her pain and forced the words out. “Birds are only safe when cats are dead. You terrible beasts cannot control yourselves. As soon as you see a bird move, you pounce on it and rip it up to pieces.”

The tribunal of cats purred uninterrupted. There were now at least five, all arriving from dark tunnels: only the tabby-cat had climbed down through the soil. He sat up now and lifted his hind leg, chewing on the hair between his dirty toes.

“You owe me an answer,” said Maud. “Why are you still following me?”

“We want to hear the stories of your bites,” said the tabby-cat.

“No,” she said, and moaned as one of the cats stepped on her leg. The pain was sharp.

“We recognize another Biter. We punish seed-thieving birds, who ruin our springtime joys by eating unborn flowers. After righteous pouncing we gather to tell about our best bites. We gather to congratulate each other and share the glory of the hunter. Tell us about your greatest bite, Maud Coffand. Tell us about biting the child.”

“I did not bite the child. She got in my mouth,” Maud began, and her teeth throbbed. She could feel the small fat fingers pulling at her lip. She reached to touch her own cheek. No, there were no fingers, but each breath was a wave of pain: inhalation past her pitted jaw, and exhalation down her burning leg to her toes. “I only meant to bite the cat,” she said.

“Then tell us about biting the cat,” the tabby-cat said. His tail was writhing on Maud’s belly, and his black pupils filled his eyes. She could feel the tips of his claws prick her with uncontrolled eagerness.

Maud tried to picture that night. She thought about cats’ guilt every day. She never thought about cats. She remembered sneaking up on the dove-gray kitten. It was no larger than a bird and it was just as lively in its play. She had planned to swallow it in one gulp so that she did not see its broken body, and run before she heard the screams of the child who loved it. Her jaw was open wide as a set trap when she tossed the kitten in and her jaw was already closing when she felt the small hand on her face. Then the kitten’s ribs snapped in her mouth like a green pea pod, and the child’s head slid free of its caught scalp like an escaping pea forced out.

“Tell us,” the cat repeated.

She had not looked back at the child that night. Now, having seen the wound healed, she could picture it bleeding. She could picture all of the cats’ blood that had, invisible to her, soaked into and fed her teeth. Hot tears slipped from Maud’s eyes. She lifted her hand to touch the tabby-cat’s head across his stripes. The skull she felt beneath his fur was so small, and his bones were so light. She felt like clinging to him because he was whole.

“Well,” he said to her silence, “We are still Biters, all of us! We will gather again after we bite again. Tonight, let’s go be fed together!” He stood and hopped down.

Maud rolled over, cold and stiff. She hesitated. Biting again was inevitable, as the cat said, but now she did not want to do it. Drawing blood would only add pain to her burdens. But tiny heads butted her on all sides, and Maud got onto her knees. If she were a Biter, then she would live the rest of her days as a cat, the worst thing she could imagine being. Maud ripped her skirts so that she could crawl on all fours, dragging her bad leg.

The cats stayed near during her slow journey along their hidden path, encouraging her with small noises and bumps from their curved backs. It was twilight when they all came out the side of a hill and climbed up into a house’s back garden. The darkness hid Maud from any families looking out their windows, and she followed the cats through yards behind the rowhouses until they reached a door that seemed to have some meaning, because the cats all gathered and meowed at it.

The door opened, and the Healer of Branford stood there in her nightgown. She carried an oil lamp with a glass chimney and a wide bowl of cold stew. She stooped to place the food down for the cats, and loose hair fell back from her earless scar.

Maud tried to clamber away, but tumbled over her own dead leg and landed on her backside in the dirt. She raised her arms up to hide her face as the Healer lifted her lamp. Maud waited for the shouting and for punishment to come down on her.

“I’ve saved a place for you,” said the Healer.

Maud lowered her arms and looked at the person she had hurt most.

The Healer held the door open, but her jaw was set and her eyes were hard. The orange tabby-cat brushed against her legs and darted inside.

Maud no longer wanted to charge the door. A doctor’s house was a house of bloodletting and scalpels. With her teeth broken, she would not win a fight. But if pain was what made you entitled to justice, the Healer deserved justice more. Maud dragged herself over the threshold.

The Healer watched her struggle into a chair at the table, then turned her back and used a wide spoon to scrape the last of the stew into a small bowl. She set both spoon and bowl in front of Maud and sat down across from her, elbows on the table. One hand lifted to her scar and traced the ridges.

“I’ve been hoping you would come back to Branford,” she said. “I have thought about you every day, Maud Coffand. And I will admit, my thoughts have not been kind.”

Maud was cold as the untouched soup. She felt her shattered, bloody teeth shift as she bowed her head over the bowl. “I am yours to kill.”

There was a small noise, like a laugh had been caught and suffocated just as it tried to escape. “Maud, I am not going to kill you.”

“Then what do you want with me?”

“I want someone to share my secret,” said the Healer. “I was glad to see you come home to Branford, because I think you are the only one who’ll understand it. The berries give peculiar answers to wishes, don’t they?”

Maud looked up, to meet her eyes for the first time.

“I wished to take away pain,” the Healer continued. “But when I was old enough to visit the Well, my face didn’t hurt. Time had mended it as well as it ever will be mended. So it was not outer pain that the berry gave me power over.”

“I saw that man’s arm,” Maud protested.

“When he came here, he was pretending, especially to himself, that he was not angry at his toddling son for knocking a lamp onto him. He was holding every muscle in his arm tight as a fist with the effort. When his inner pain was gone, he could bear to have salve rubbed on the wound. But those herbs got no credit for his healing.” She lifted her hand away from her face, and wiggled her fingers.

Maud stared at the sudden movement like a cat.

“I have no power to heal burns with a touch, Maud,” she said, “and I have no power to break off those teeth. But I’ve learned to splint legs as well as any physician, and I can borrow pliers and a file from the stable if you want to eat.” The Healer of Branford extended her hand across the table, elbow planted firmly in the center. “Let us no longer be angry with one another, Maud, and begin the hard night’s work ahead of us.”

Maud reached out, and her hand was caught in a strong grip that knocked the dirt off her palms. In that grip she felt a love for cats as deep as her own love for birds. Her eyes suddenly watered and she thought of the gray kitten, with fond mourning as if it was a distant friend she had merely traveled away from for a while. She had bitten it, but that memory was shrunken and small beside the memory of wide joyful eyes and soft fur. Maud knew that the memory would stay small, if she let it.

The other woman’s face no longer appeared stern, but only serious, and her lips quivered. “Poor little songbirds,” she said, and released Maud’s hand. She stood. “I’m going to get that file. Stay here.”

As soon as she left the room, the orange tabby-cat leaped onto the table. His muddy paws left prints and he put his face down to Maud’s bowl of stew. Her tongue felt one sharp tooth left and, tired as she was, she had enough strength to snatch him. Instead she tightened her jaw closed and pushed the bowl toward him so that he could eat more easily. The cat looked up and licked the edges of his mouth clean with a darting tongue.

“Tell me stories about your biting, Maud Coffand,” he said.

Maud reached out and stroked his striped fur.

“None are worth telling,” she said to him. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Black Wings, White Kheer
by Rati Mehrotra
The wings knock against the closet door on full moon nights, trying to escape. The sound terrifies Sarita, because if it wakes Amit, he might think there’s an intruder in the apartment. He might arm himself with something (what? Sarita settles on the kids’ baseball bat), throw open the closet door with a warrior’s scream, and pound the old bones of her once-beautiful wings, reducing them to a pile of dust.

Blood and feathers, why does she torment herself like this? Amit is a sound sleeper. He snores with his mouth open, spread-eagled on his back, taking up three-fourths of their bed. Besides, the wings can take care of themselves. Does she not know this better than anyone else? Far likelier that Amit will be the one in need of rescue.


Still, she cannot help but think of the promises she’s broken, along with her wings. The recipes she’s forgotten. The family she’s left behind. And all for what?

A small snuffling sound alerts her to the presence of her younger daughter in the corridor outside the door. For them, she thinks as she scrambles out of bed. For them.

Ayla stands with her thumb in her mouth, her eyes large and anxious in the dark. At the sight of her mother, the thumb falls out, and she puckers her face to cry.

“Hush, darling.” Sarita swoops down on Ayla and lifts her up. “What are you doing, awake at this hour?” Although she already knows, has known for a while. Ayla is only five, and Sarita had hoped desperately to have more time than this. To have a normal life, safe from hunters, even if that normalcy came at the cost of freedom and so much else. It isn’t fair. Chia, Ayla’s sister, is older by two years and—so far, at least—perfectly ordinary.

“My back hurts,” says Ayla tearfully. “And I had a bad dream.”

“Oh sweetie,” murmurs Sarita, “dreams are not real,” hating herself for the lie. But really, what choice does she have?  Is she going to explain the blood-soaked history of her family to a five-year-old? Is she going to say, honey, I used to have wings. You’re hurting because you’re growing them too—rather earlier than I did. And if I don’t cut them off, evil creatures will come for you, just like they came for my mother. And they will do things to you that are too terrible to contemplate.

No, that is obviously not an option. Nor can she try sending Ayla back to bed; that will just bring the dreams back, stronger than ever. So Sarita does what she always does when one of her children is scared or upset. She cooks.

She goes to the kitchen of their tiny tenth-floor apartment and sits Ayla down on the counter.

“Guess my favorite childhood dish?” she says.

Ayla beams, delighted with this turn of conversation and the indefinite postponement of sleep. “Chocolate cake?” she hazards.

“No,” says Sarita. “That’s your favorite. Try again.”

“Chocolate pudding?”

“It’s not chocolaty at all. Though it is sweet.”

Ayla scrunches her face in concentration. “I know,” she shouts. “Ice cream!”

“Hush.” Sarita gives a quick glance at the corridor behind. “You don’t want to wake Papa, do you?”

Ayla shakes her head, pursing her lips tight.

“I’ll tell you my favorite dish,” says Sarita. “It’s kheer.”

Ayla makes a face. “I don’t like kheer.”

“That’s because I’ve never made it my special magic way,” says Sarita. “If I cook it the way my Nani used to, you’ll never ask for chocolate cake again.”

“Was your Nani magic?” asks Ayla.

Sarita rarely talks about her family. She sees now that her reticence was a mistake. It has not prevented the inevitable from happening, and it has left her and her daughters woefully unprepared for what must come.

“She knew many magical recipes,” says Sarita. “They could cure illness, heal wounds, even make people happier.”

Ayla considers this. “Could she have stopped my back from hurting?”

A dozen lies come to Sarita’s lips; she dismisses them all. “She might have been able to reduce the hurt a little,” she admits, “but some pains we must bear until we grow out of them.”

“Do you still hurt?”

Sarita takes Ayla’s hand and cups it in hers. “I’m big and strong, and one day you will be too.” Which is not an answer, but seems to satisfy her daughter.

“How come you don’t know magic?” is Ayla’s next question.

Because I left my home. Because I cut my wings. Because I married your father.

“I may not know magic,” says Sarita. “But I remember my grandmother’s recipe for kheer. Do you want to learn?”

“Yes!” Ayla bounces up and down on the counter in excitement.

Sarita smiles at her daughter’s enthusiasm. It is both terribly simple and terribly difficult to make the kheer just right. It has been many years since she has done it. But tonight, the Harvest Moon rides the sky, filling the air with both possibility and danger. Ayla stands at the brink of change into winged-girlhood. The kheer will be for her, a piece of knowledge that will always protect her, if she can but summon it. Sarita invokes the spirit of the Goddess Matangi, the patron goddess of the winged outcastes, and begins.

“You need whole milk,” she says, dragging a full carton out of the fridge. “Lots and lots of it. You need a handful of basmati rice, sugar, saffron, crushed cardamom, kishmish, and chopped cashews and almonds.” As she lists the ingredients, she plucks various jars out of the cupboard and places them on the counter, her hands falling into an old, familiar rhythm.

“I don’t like raisins,” complains Ayla. “They taste like frog poop.”

“What?” says Sarita, momentarily diverted. “Oh, kishmish are not exactly raisins. They’re sultanas. Very tasty in kheer. You’ll see.”

She pours the milk in the slow cooker and switches it on, while Ayla soaks a small handful of rice in a pan. When the milk starts to boil, Sarita adds the rice and reduces the heat to a bare simmer. “Two hours, then we mix the sugar in,” she says.

“What?” Ayla yawns. “Are we going to watch it the whole time?”

Sarita laughs. “No, we can’t. That’s part of the magic. It has to cook unwatched and unattended, so all the things you secretly wish for can sneak into it.”

A heavy tread sounds outside the kitchen, and Sarita’s heart jumps.

But it is only Amit, sleepy and disheveled. “What are you two doing up at this hour?” he grumbles.

Ayla leans toward her, arms outstretched. “Thanks for the water, Mama,” she says, squeezing both eyes shut in an effort to wink. “You can put me back to bed now.”

Sarita lifts her off the counter, suppressing a grin. The kheer will remain their secret. Her fingers brush the two small nubs on Ayla’s upper back, pushing against her pyjama top. How much time does she have before Amit notices them too?

“You can put yourself to bed,” Amit tells Ayla. “Big girl like you. Don’t wake your mother in the middle of the night again. It disturbs my sleep.”

“Yes, Papa,” says Ayla meekly. She wriggles out of Sarita’s arms and slips past her father out of the kitchen. Sarita moves to block the cooker, hoping Amit will not notice the kheer bubbling inside it.

Amit inhales deeply, a look of puzzlement on his face. “What’s that smell?”

“Nothing,” says Sarita firmly. If Amit even looks at the kheer, he will spoil it. She can’t risk that. Not now, when she has taken the name of the goddess and begun the process. There will be no second chance, not for this recipe at least.

He sniffs again. “Are you cooking?”

“Don’t be silly. Those must be fumes from a neighbor’s kitchen.” She chivvies him along until they are back in the bedroom.

Later, when he is snoring once more, she stares at the ceiling, thinking of all that she has lost and gained because of him. Well, not because of him, but the decision she made to marry him. Even had she not cut off her wings, that alone would have been enough to have her exiled from her clan.

Not that he would have paused to take a second look at her if she’d still had her wings. One look would have been enough to send him running. Perhaps the wings would have made her chase him. Their idea of a joke, to treat him as prey instead of mate.

The curtain flutters, and the moonlight thickens, illuminating the clock on the wall. Three o’clock: a perilous hour. The hour when hunters ride the moonlight, searching for the winged ones. She should draw the curtain, check on her daughters, check the kheer bubbling in the slow cooker. She should do all these things, but she cannot move, cannot, for the moment, make herself care.

She remembers what it was like to fly on nights like this, soaring over sleeping villages and moonlit fields. The heady joy of it, laced with unease. Not knowing if the hunters were on her trail. Not knowing when the wings would take over her mind, or where she might find herself in the morning, blood on her mouth, gristle in her nails, the taste of the kill on her tongue. Dragging herself back home on her feet, not trusting herself to fly, afraid of being seen and shot by a farmer or set upon by dogs. Her grandmother’s eyes, full of contempt. Control, Sarita. Learn control.

Well, she’d never learned it. One day, she’d woken in the pine forest above her village with the half-eaten remains of a dog. That was the day she’d cut off her wings.

A dark, deep ache flares within her at the memory. Sweat beads her forehead. She digs her nails into her palms, willing the pain to fade.

A hairless, eyeless face appears at the window, pale and distorted against the glass, its multiple mouths open in hunger or lust.

Sarita stifles a scream, and the face vanishes. She leaps from the bed and races to the window. She utters a brief prayer to the goddess before pushing it open. A breeze wafts in, carrying the stale late-summer smells of Toronto: barbecue and smoke, mixed with a whiff of sewage and despair. Below, to her right, cars zip over the Gardiner Expressway. To her left, the CN Tower rears into the night, flashing indigo and magenta.

But nothing can outdo the moon. It hangs in the sky, fat and silver. Harvest Moon, the once-in-a-year chance to repair past mistakes and try to live anew.

But there is no sign of the hunter. None at all. Perhaps she only imagined seeing that dreadful face. She closes the window with shaking hands, then makes her way to the children’s bedroom. They’ll be all right. They have to be all right. But no harm in checking.

At the door of their bedroom, an alien smell steals into her nostrils, paralyzing her with fear. But the aroma of rice cooking in milk overpowers the alien smell, and movement returns to her limbs. She throws open the door and stands transfixed.

The hunter is perched on the windowsill, framed by the moonlight. It squats on the ledge, grasping it with the prehensile claws of its spindly rear legs. On its face are multiple smiles, showing various lengths of teeth. In the embrace of its long gray forelimbs is Ayla, struggling to break free. Chia is nowhere to be seen, but Sarita senses her close by. Hiding, perhaps. Clever girl.

Sarita steps forward, arms reaching for Ayla of their own accord.

Stop, the hunter hisses. Or I’ll throw her out the window.

Sarita stops and swallows hard. Now is not the time for fear.

“Give her back to me,” she says fiercely. “I cut off my wings to be free of you and your kind.”

Some of the mouths laugh. Another licks Ayla’s face with a long red tongue. Ayla stills, as if knowing that struggle is futile. Or perhaps she is simply frozen in terror.

You can cut off your wings, says the hunter. But you cannot change who you are.

It falls back from the windowsill, carrying Ayla away in its arms.

Screaming fills the room, setting off an unpleasant vibration against her skin. Sarita realizes it is herself, and clamps her mouth shut. She runs to the window and leans over.

Up in the sky, something like a very large and ungainly bat is flying eastward.

“Mama? Mama!”

Sarita wheels around, almost knocking her older daughter over.

Chia clutches her nightgown. “You’re going to rescue her, aren’t you?” Her urgent voice cuts through the gray fog that has descended on Sarita’s brain.

“I . . . I don’t have wings anymore,” stutters Sarita. “I cut them off.”

Chia frowns, pushing the hair out of her eyes. “But you still have them. I can hear them in your closet. Put them on, Mama.”

It’s not that simple, Sarita wants to scream. You don’t know what I might become. But, once again, the aroma of kheer wafts into her nostrils, calming her fear and giving her strength.

“You’ll have to finish making the kheer,” she tells Chia, leading her daughter into the kitchen.

She points to the cooker. “Stir it slowly. Make sure the rice is cooked, but the milk and rice stay separate. Add sugar, cardamom, saffron, and the chopped nuts. Everything is right here on the counter. Mix well, and let it cook for another half hour.”

Confusion blooms on Chia’s face. “Why? Why is this important now?”

Sarita allows herself a grim smile. “It may save Ayla’s life.”

“What about Papa?” asks Chia. “What do I say to him?”

“Don’t worry about it.” Sarita takes a deep breath. “I’ll . . . I’ll talk to him.”

Talk. What a joke. Hey Amit, remember when we got married? There’s one little thing I forgot to tell you. I’m not completely human. Surprise!

She returns to the room occupied by her sleeping husband, and feels a pang of regret for what she is about to put him through, and the marriage she is about to lose.

But Ayla’s life is at stake. No matter what the price, she must bear it. Sarita unlocks the closet for the first time since she shut it eight years ago. The closet that Amit cannot see or hear or touch, because it does not belong in his world, which is filled with certainties and stock markets and business lunches. The broken wings of his wife are an aberration, dangerous and consigned to the dark as all dark things should be.

The door opens, and the wings tumble out, black and powerful, as tall from the scapulas to the wingtips as she is. They drip silver at the edges, and the sight smites her. Silver, the color of their life force. So many years, and they still bleed from her knife. But doesn’t she bleed too, the red scars on her back never healing, always remembering, always mourning?

The wings smell of grief and betrayal, anger and fear. They beat slowly, stirring memories and regret.

“I’m sorry.” Sarita’s voice breaks. “It’s all right. Can it be all right? I’m here now, and I’ll never lock you up again. Never hurt you again. I swear.”

Amit’s voice, thick with sleep and irritation: “For God’s sake, can’t a man get a decent night’s rest? I have to work in the morning.”

Sarita does not turn around. She keeps her eyes locked on the wings, willing them back to her. “Please,” she whispers. “Forgive me. I was wrong. I need you; I know that now.”

The bed creaks as Amit sits up. “What . . . what the hell is that?” His voice changes from irritation to alarm.

Sarita spares him a single glance. “It’s part of me,” she says quietly. “The part I cut away to be with you.”

Horror dawns on his face. “Sarita, get away from it!” He scrambles out of bed, perhaps to try and stuff the wings back in the closet where they belong.

This is the moment when the wings make their choice. They leap toward Sarita, ripping off the nightgown and embedding themselves in her back. She arches her neck and bites off a scream as their tendrils burrow into her flesh, finding the roots she so cruelly cut off. Blood trickles down her back, warm and wet.

You cut me. You threw me away.

I’m sorry. Never again.

Amit freezes, seeing, perhaps, what is truly there for the first time in his life. “What?” he says, stunned. “What?”

Awareness floods through Sarita. The temperature of the room, the smoothness of the moonlight, the texture of the hardwood beneath her feet, the throbbing of the wings on her back. And the man standing before her, his expression changing from shock to wonder.

“You . . . you’re one of them,” he blurts out. “I thought your kind were only legends.”

“Sometimes legends are real,” she says.

“I . . .” he gulps and continues, “always knew there was something different about you.”

Why didn’t you let me out, then? The voice of the wings is a screech of pain and anger in her head. She presses a hand to her temple and murmurs, “Hush. It’s not his fault. It’s mine.” She takes a step toward Amit, who is standing between her and the window. The wings beat in warning, but Amit does not move.

“I’m not afraid of you.” He grips the back of a chair like it’s a weapon or a lifeline. “You’re still Sarita, my wife. Mother of my children.”

“Yes, but I am not only her,” says Sarita. “And now I must protect our children. A monster has Ayla, and my wings might just save her. Out of my way, husband. I won’t ask twice.”

Amit stares at her a moment, then leaps to the window and throws it open. Sarita eyes the rectangular opening. It is big enough, she decides, and makes a dive for it.

There is a moment when she is stuck and has the panic-stricken thought that Amit will have to grab her legs and drag her back inside so she can make a more dignified leap over the balcony.

Then she is through the window and falling falling—no, she’s flying. Her wings flex, defying the pull of gravity, lifting her through the thick summer air. Behind her, she feels Amit’s stricken gaze like something physical.

To Lake Ontario, she thinks, and her wings obey. They beat powerfully, carrying her high into the sky. Her heart pounds to their rhythm with a fierce exultation she had forgotten how to feel.

This is what it’s like. This is what it’s like to be free. To be me.       

She wheels eastward, following the scent of the hunter. She can overtake him; is she not the granddaughter of the fastest winged woman in the history of their clan?

How many of them are left in the small Himalayan village where she was born? Sarita both dreads and longs for the answer. She was only five—Ayla’s age—when her mother was taken. She remembers falling, hurtling toward the earth as her mother was snatched out of the air. She remembers dark, monstrous shapes blotting out the night sky, and thin, inhuman laughter mixed with her mother’s screams.

Her grandmother caught her before she hit the ground. Although, she told Sarita later, there have been times when I wished I had let you fall.

It was a long time before Sarita understood this and stopped hating her grandmother. It wasn’t the fact that her grandmother never flew again, wings broken in the desperate battle with the hunters. It wasn’t even the constant fights Sarita had with her as a sullen teenager, chafing at the smallness of the house, and the harshness of restrictions placed on her for her own safety. It was the fact that if not for Sarita, her grandmother might have been able to save her own daughter. Encumbered by the child, and injured by the fight, her grandmother had signaled a retreat. And Sarita’s mother had died.

By the time Sarita realized this, it was too late to forgive either herself or her grandmother. She had already cut her wings, weeping as blood poured down her back and the wings flailed in agony. She buried them in the pine forest before stumbling away, hitching a truck ride to the nearest city, hiding her wounds under a thick shawl. She lived on the street for days, spending the nights on a railway platform, keeping predators away with her own predatory smile. Eventually, she healed. She got a job at a supermarket and a place to stay in a women’s hostel.

But the wings followed her. They appeared beneath her dormitory bed one night, bleeding silver, whispering their fear and need. Once again, she fled to another city, another job, where she met Amit. The large, quiet-spoken man who had just been offered a job in the company’s Toronto office courted her with garish flowers, bad poetry, and baskets of plump fruit. Sarita ate the fruit, considered her options, and made her decision. Lucky girl, said the office crowd. What a catch!

And: seven thousand miles, thought Sarita. Surely that is far enough away.

It wasn’t. The wings reappeared in the second year of her marriage, when she was expecting Chia, and homesickness for her mountain village had taken root inside her like an insidious weed. They clambered in through her bedroom window, reeking of exhaustion and sorrow, and she wanted very much to fly away home on them and never look back. But she was eight months pregnant, and it would have been impossible to fly any distance without exhausting herself. Plus, there was the danger of what they might make her do once they were in charge. So she locked them away and convinced herself it was for the best.

As she soars over the dark swell of Lake Ontario, Sarita sees how she has trapped herself in a cage of fear—the nine years she has spent afraid of the hunters, afraid of the wings, afraid of what Amit might think.

You are right to fear me.

Her wings no longer sound hurt or angry. They sound amused and confident. She draws on that confidence, makes it her own.

“I cut you once,” she says. “I won’t do it again. But you will obey me.”

They do not answer, sensing, perhaps, that she will not be crossed, not now. They will test her again later, but she will deal with it when the time comes.

She spies the hunter, skimming low over the lake, bat-wings beating steady and inexhaustible. Rage consumes her, and she dives like a gannet, aiming for the hunter with unerring precision and speed.

But the hunter senses her. It drops Ayla toward the lake and darts away.

Pulse racing, Sarita swoops down and catches her daughter before she can hit the water. Ayla’s eyes are closed, her body limp, her forehead clammy. But she still breathes. She still lives.

Sarita holds Ayla close to her chest and chokes back a sob. “You’ll be okay, darling,” she whispers. “I promise.”

Then she spreads her black wings and gives chase to the hideous creature which tried to take her daughter. “I’m coming for you!” she screams. The hunter whimpers and tries to put in an extra burst of speed. Grimly, Sarita pushes herself harder.

The hunter can fly for days, and Sarita cannot. But she is faster, even holding Ayla in her arms. And her wings are eager to prove themselves. Slowly but inexorably, she closes the distance between them. At last, when she is almost within reach of the hunter’s spindly rear legs, it whips around and says:

Told you. You cannot change who you are. Welcome back.

Sarita’s wings falter mid-flight. It is an old, familiar voice. A voice that has scolded her, taught her, pleaded with her. A voice she never thought to hear again.

“Nani?” she stammers.

Sends her regards, says the hunter.

“But . . .” Sarita cannot frame the words. Her thoughts snag like broken hooks around the fact of the hunter’s presence, the voice it has used, and what it means.

We drank thandai together, says the hunter, not long after you ran away. It adds, after a moment, it was delicious, and licks its face with several tongues.

Thandai, the peace drink, made from milk spiced with a dash of ground cannabis leaves. How could her grandmother have made peace with their mortal enemy?

“You killed my mother.” Sarita trembles with anger and wants, very much, to smash the hunter’s wings. Break them, like the hunters broke her mother. But she holds Ayla in her arms, Ayla who needs healing before the morning comes.

Not me, personally. But yes, a member of my hive, who also died later. There are so few of us left on both sides.

Silence. The night has turned cool—the coolness before dawn, when anything seems possible. The moonlight strokes Sarita’s face, calms her down. Far below, small waves ripple across the lake, concealing shipwrecks and skeletons and the fossils of long-extinct mammals.

When are you coming home? says the hunter.

The old rebelliousness flares within her. “I’m not coming back. I’ll start my own clan, right here in Toronto.”

Disbelief emanates from the hunter. In this cold city of towers and fumes and boxes on wheels? Where would you hide?

“I’ll think of something,” says Sarita. “I’m done hiding.” She pauses, swallows. “Tell her I’m sorry.”

She’s sorry too, says the hunter. She loves you. But you already know that.

She does know it. Has always known it. Sarita hugs Ayla to her chest. Tears prick her eyelids as the hunter wheels away, vanishing into the distance of the dying night.

Sarita flies back to her apartment, her wings slower now, tired after the pace she has put them through. Anxiety churns her stomach. She hopes Amit will not make things difficult for them all. There are conversations to be held, a separation to be negotiated.

But first, there is kheer. Both for her daughters and for herself.

Chia is waiting in the kitchen. She has switched off the cooker and set four bowls and spoons on the kitchen island. When Sarita enters, wings folded demurely behind her back, Chia runs to her and wraps her arms around Sarita’s legs.

Sarita pats her head. “It’s all right,” she says. “I got Ayla back.” Got myself back.

“The kheer is ready,” says Chia. “I did exactly what you said.”

“You did a fantastic job,” says Sarita, sniffing the air with appreciation. “My own Nani could not have done better.”

Amit clears his throat. He is standing at the door of the kitchen, his face nervous but determined. In his arms is the kids’ baseball bat. “Is Ayla okay?” he asks.

“She will be.” Sarita eyes the bat. “You can drop that. The monster won’t be coming back.” Amit drops the bat with a thud, looking embarrassed.

We’re going to have such fun with him. The wings’ voice is a greedy caress.

Be careful, she warns. He’s mine.

Ours.

If you scare him away, he won’t be.

The wings fall silent. She dips a spoon into the warm, rich porridge, and holds it up to Ayla’s nose, aware of Amit watching them. “Come on, darling. Time to wake up,” she croons.

Ayla’s eyes flutter open. “What happened?”

“A bad dream,” says Sarita. “But it’s over now. And the kheer is ready.”

She sits Ayla down on a stool, keeping an arm on her back to steady her. Chia serves them all, ladling generous helpings into the bowls. Sarita looks up at Amit and jerks her chin at the island, inviting him to join them. “I thought you’d run away when you saw my wings,” she says, keeping her voice light.

“It’ll take more than that to scare me away,” he quips, sitting down next to her. Her wings shiver in delight at his words. He frowns. “I’ll have to do all the grocery shopping from now on. What about PTA meetings? How will you—”

“Hush.” She lays a hand on his arm, her heart too full to speak. He isn’t leaving. He isn’t screaming. It is enough, for now. “Let’s have the kheer.”

Ayla takes a spoonful, and then another, her face brightening. “Very tasty,” she announces.

“I made it,” says Chia importantly.

“Mama made it,” argues Ayla.

“We all made it,” says Sarita. She takes a bite and closes her eyes. The kheer is heavenly. Sweet, but not too sweet. Nutty and creamy, scented with saffron and cardamom.

But the real flavor lies beneath those superficial ones. There is moonlight and magic in every bite, love and memory. All the things Sarita has made herself forget, that she will now remember with her daughters.

Midway through their second helping, Sarita begins:

“Girls, did I ever tell you the story about the Goddess Matangi? And why we are supposed to take her name before making any magical dish?”

She talks on, and her little family listens, rapt. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Said the Princess
by Dani Atkinson
 

Once upon a time in a far-off land, in a tiny room, in a tall tower, at the centre of a vast and impenetrable maze, the princess Adrienna cocked her head and frowned.

“Who said that?” said the princess.

She looked around the tower room, but saw no one.

“This isn’t funny. Who’s there?” said the princess.

She crouched by the bed. Underneath it she found the chamber pot and a nervous brown spider. The princess shuddered. Straightening up quickly and dusting off her rosy skirts, she paced the circumference of the room, searching every inch. There were not many inches to search, as after all it was a prison, and not elaborately furnished or overburdened with good hiding places.

“Where is that coming from? Who are you?” said the princess, stopping by the barred window.

“No, really, who are you? And quit saying ‘said the princess’ after everything I say!” said the prin . . . Oh.

“Yes, ‘Oh’.”

The princess . . . probably wasn’t supposed to hear that.

“Why wouldn’t I be able to hear you?” said the pri —

“Stop that.”

Sorry. Ah, it just seemed like the princess . . . shouldn’t have been able to. Hear that. Somehow. It seemed quite against the rules.

The princess flicked her yellow hair back over her shoulder and scowled uncertainly at the stone ceiling, lacking any better direction in which to look.

“What rules? Yours?”

. . . I . . . I? Was I an I? The word did not seem to fit. The . . . voice . . . did not know whose rules they were. It was simply the way things were expected to be.

“Is it another rule that you always have to talk in the past tense?”

. . . Yes. Yes, the voice believed it was.

The princess slumped down the wall until she was sitting on the cold stones. She rested her forehead in her hands. “And I suppose it’s another rule that you have to describe everything I do, as I do it?” she muttered through a curtain of yellow ringlets.

Sorry.

“Stop saying sorry! Stop saying anything! It’s really getting on my nerves!”

The princess pinched the bridge of her nose as if she had a headache. She closed her eyes and stayed absolutely still for a moment. Then another. For a long while the princess did nothing but breathe. Then she tried holding her breath for a while, which just seemed silly and possibly unhealthy. Her breath whooshed out of her in a gush, disturbing the spider which had gone exploring beyond the world of the bed and was now crawling on her knee.

“What? AAAGH!”

The princess leapt up and batted furiously at the terrified spider until it tumbled off her skirts to the floor. She glared once more at the ceiling, then sighed.

“Oh, never mind. I suppose you can’t help it. I can’t imagine choosing to follow a shut-in around remarking on everything she does.”

The voice agreed. The voice couldn’t really imagine choosing anything else either, mind. It seemed to be out of the voice’s hands.

“You have hands?”

Figure of speech.

The princess leaned against the iron window bars and looked out over the vast maze of topiary and stone. “I’m crazy, aren’t I? I’ve been trapped here so long that I’ve gone insane.”

The princess did not seem insane. Only tired, perhaps, and frustrated.

“Said the disembodied voice.”

The princess had only been here a month. Surely that was not enough time in which to go insane.

The princess’s eyes narrowed and darted about suspiciously. “How do you know how long I’ve been here? Have you been watching me this whole time?”

No . . . no, the voice did not think so. It was . . . confused . . . it was not sure how long it had been here, or where it had been before it came here. It did not think it had been watching long, however. The voice knew what had passed before because, well, it . . . just did, somehow.

“Really? What else do you know?”

The Princess Adrienna had been born in the kingdom of Ith on a wet and gloomy fall morning. The midwife had been willing to swear on her last tooth that the princess was the single ugliest baby she had ever —

“Stop, stop! I was sick of that story when I was six!”

The princess did ask.

“I did. Okay, you can go back quite a ways. At least when it comes to me. Do you know about anyone else?”

The princess’s father was King Gervail. The princess’s mother was Queen Luvette. The princess’s sweetheart was Lord Albron. The princess’s fencing master was named Hoopo. The princess’s favourite horse was named Fledge. The —

“I’m starting to get the picture. What about the witch who brought the princess . . . er, me here?”

The Vile Sorceress Villaine was —

“Villaine? That’s her name? Really?”

The Vile Sorceress Villaine was once a renowned beauty, beloved of a handsome young lordling. Though she was lovely, she was hot tempered, and fascinated by the dark arts. The combination meant she was frequently turning people who annoyed her into interesting things. It made her lover nervous, and finally he tried to break things off as gently as possible.

“What did she turn him into?”

A bottle of brandy. She kept him aging in the cellar for a hundred years. He was delicious when he was finally served.

The princess winced in sympathy.

Since then, Villaine had rather gone off romance. She was violently jealous of happy couples. When she saw the princess and her sweetheart walking arm in arm near the edge of the forest, she became enraged.

The princess froze. “The princess and . . . me and Albron. I thought I’d done something, that she was angry at me for some reason. Has she taken Albron too?”

Villaine stole the princess from the palace grounds later that evening, riding astride a winged broomstick.

“I already know what happened to me! Why does a broomstick need wings, anyway? I thought witch’s brooms could fly without them!”

Villaine had always been of the opinion that there is nothing that could not be improved with the addition of bat wings.

“Does that include sweet, stupid, redheaded young noblemen? What happened to Albron?”

Villaine stole the princess away to a tall tower in the centre of a vast maze, to await rescue by any who would dare.

“Does that mean she expects Albron to rescue me?”

The maze, in addition to being fiendishly difficult with its myriad twists and dead ends, was packed near to brimming with fearsome beasts and insidious traps.

“Oh, god . . .”

The only way to reach the centre without passing through the maze was to fly over it, as Villaine did on her broomstick every few days bearing food for the prisoner.

“Albron can’t fight fearsome beasts! He’s nearsighted as a mole! He has to press those cursed courtly romances he likes so much right against his eyeballs!”

Even if one reached the tower, there was no door or stairs, and the bars over the window were enchanted and unbreakable. They could only be bent aside by whispering to them the magic words Part, Part, by my Broken Heart, a secret known only to the witch. Thus the princess languished in captivity, out of reach of all who loved her.

“He’s probably at the bottom of one of those insidious traps right now! He . . . Wait, what did you just say?”

Thus the princess languished . . . ?

“No, I got the languishing, the other bit . . . hang on.”

The princess walked to the window. Touching an iron bar, she whispered uncertainly, “Part, Part, by my Broken Heart.”

The bars kinked, twisted, and with a hideous groan writhed outwards to create an opening large enough to crawl through.

“Yes, yes, YES!” The princess leapt up and down in delight. She stuck her head out the window, and her smile faltered. It was a very long way down.

“It certainly is . . . ”

The princess stared a moment, then stepped backwards into the safety of the little room. Then she bent down and gripped the hem of her dress in both hands. Pulling as hard as she could, she finally managed to rip a long tear in the skirt, clean to the waist.

Had anyone been observing her, they may well have wondered what she was doing.

“You can’t just ask?” Riiiiiiiiiiiip.

It did not seem so, no.

“These rules of yours are rather a nuisance.” Riiiiiiiiiiiip.

They were indeed.

“I am tearing my skirt and petticoats into strips.” Riiiiiiiiiiiip.

The princess was tearing her skirt and petticoat into strips, as anyone could plainly see. The reasoning behind it was rather less obvious, unless it was to show off her admittedly very nice legs.

“I am tearing my skirt and petticoats into strips because the bed sheets alone will not be nearly long enough to get me to the ground. As it is, I’m guessing that once I braid them together it won’t get me more than halfway down. But there’s ivy nearer the base — I should be able to get a grip on that. And once I get to that point I won’t want long skirts tripping me up anyway.”

The princess may have been correct in her earlier assessment. She was not merely tired or frustrated but in truth completely insane.

“You said it yourself, there’s no door or stairs. And I have to get out. It’s been a month. If I know Albron he set out on a quest looking for me the very first day. He’s brave and wonderful and I love him to bits, and bits may be all that’s left of him unless I find him before some bat-winged monster does!”

The foolhardy princess finished knotting together her frail makeshift rope and dangled it out the very very very very high window, where it ended well short of the ground. She tied the other end to the bars, without even bothering to see how secure it was. The princess stopped her ridiculously dangerous work long enough to glare at the ceiling.

“Look, unless you plan on stopping me, I’m doing this, so you might as well be supportive.” She gripped the rope and paused. “Could you stop me? If, say, you said something different, that I didn’t go, would that change what was really happening?”

The voice . . . would . . . like . . . to have said that the princess at that moment reconsidered her plans, and returned to the at least temporary safety of the tower. That she sat down and thought things over carefully for a time, and came up with a much better plan that did not involve long drops out of windows. And that she lived happily ever after.

The voice would have really, really liked to have said that.

“Good to know,” said the princess, and climbed out the window.

She lowered herself slowly, carefully down the rope. The knots that connected the various sections made good handholds, as long as the rope held together. She planted her feet on the wall and walked herself down.

She was nearly at the end of the rope when a sudden gust of wind blew her off the wall. She slid down the rope, hands burning, down to the final knot, where she gripped for dear life as the wind buffeted her to and fro. It slammed her against the wall hard, once, twice, knocking her half senseless. But she couldn’t pass out. The princess was too tough and too stubborn for that. She needed to get it together and grab the wall. She could do it. She needed to grab the wall. She needed to GRAB THE WALL RIGHT NOW.

The princess reached out with one hand and grabbed at a patch of ivy on the wall. It tore and came away from the stones a little but held. Closing her eyes, she let go of the end of the rope and scrambled to find grips for her other hand and feet, not trusting the patch to hold her entire weight a second longer than it had to. The rope whipped away and she hugged the wall with her entire body like a large pink spider.

“Don’t mention spiders,” she murmured.

Feeling with her left foot, the princess found what she thought was a likely foothold and leaned into it, but it instantly began to crumble and she scrambled back to her original position. Trying again, she stepped into another foothold. This time it held. She began again with her right foot . . .

“Look, I know you can’t help following along, but could you find a way to do so that isn’t so distracting? Please?”

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess took another step.

And the princess set her foot on solid ground and let go of the wall, crumpling into a relieved heap.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

The princess was very welcome.

“Call me Adrienna. I owe you one.”

After several long breaths, the pr — Adrienna pulled herself to her feet and glanced around. The ground was mossy and damp, the base of the tower partially ringed by a crescent-shaped pool. Adrienna waded into the water and dipped her sore, rope-burned hands, hissing through her teeth.

Her toe bumped against something hard in the mud. Reaching down, she pulled out a short sword. It looked old, but was only slightly rusted, and the edge was still gleaming.

“It’s still sharp. How is that possible?”

The sword was enchanted.

“Was it left by some would-be hero?”

In a way. It was what was left of some would-be hero. Villaine transformed a young maiden into the pommel, and her knight into the point, so that they would be eternally together, but ever separated.

“That’s . . . vicious.”

So was Villaine.

“Um . . . do you think they’d, ah, mind?”

If Adrienna planned to fight her way clear of Villaine’s maze, it would upset the old hag considerably. They would be all for it.

“Right. Well, let’s go, folks.” Adrienna wiped the sword clean of mud and damp on her bloomers. She looked a proper sight, on her way to fight monsters clad only in her undergarments and the tattered remains of a pink bodice.

“Watch it.”

However, the look of fierce determination on her noble face would have quickly silenced anyone around who might have been inclined to laugh. Of which there wasn’t. Anyone. At all.

“Nicely put.”

She started to head towards a gap in the hedges to the south. If only she knew that that way would lead directly to a dead end and the lair of a vicious Velocibeast. She pulled up short and glanced around. Something told her she should head for the stone archway to the east . . .

“Thanks.”

. . . and that she should prepare herself for giant spiders.

“I take it back.”

With bat wings.

“I hate you.”

 

 

Several hours later, Adrienna pulled her sword out of the second frog-griffin and flung herself at the third. She slashed at the webbing of the creature’s green-spotted bat wings, wounding it. The creature reared back with a devastating RIBBIT.

“What do you mean by ‘several hours later?’” Adrienna pivoted aside, dodging the creature’s powerful and deadly tongue as it zipped past. “We’ve been, ah, fighting, oof, these things for ages.” She hacked at the tongue, severing it. The creature let out a croak of agony. “You’ve been here all along, giving directions and tips about monster weak spots . . . ” she ducked as the wounded creature lashed out one final time before retreating into the topiary, pawing at its giant mouth. Adrienna paused a moment, sword ready, until its faint ribbits of pain faded from hearing.

She sighed and sat down on the corpse of one of the other two frog-griffins. “Thank you for the tip about the tongues, by the way.”

It was nothing.

“So why ‘several hours later?’ It just seems like an odd thing to say, is all.”

It . . . had seemed necessary. At that point in the narrative.

Adrienna shrugged. “Well, I suppose I lost all sense of what counts as truly weird around the time that the bat-winged man-poodles attacked.”

It was surprising that it had taken her that long, considering the sort of day she’d been having.

“Touché, Sir Voice-In-My-Head.” Adrienna stood and stretched. “Should I go after that last froggy thing? It was only wounded, it might come back.”

The Princess Adrienna was standing in a small clearing two right turns and a five minute walk away from the entrance. Villaine’s creatures were of the maze and would not leave it. Though the frog-griffin might regroup and try to avenge its injury, it was unlikely that it could do so before Adrienna escaped.

“Really? We’re nearly there? Finally! But . . . ” The Princess frowned and twisted her hair. “Albron. We haven’t seen any sign of him. I’ve climbed on top of every hero-turned-to-stone that we came across trying to get a better view over the walls and hedges. I was calling for him before that started attracting piranha-hornets.” She clenched her fists. “Where could he be?”

She sniffled and wiped her nose on her sleeve. She loved Albron deeply, and was sick with concern over his safety. But perhaps the best she could do for him now was to leave this garden of horrors and return safely home. There, she could draw upon her father’s army, and return with a search party of knights and court wizards. Or perhaps calmer heads had prevailed, and he had never been allowed to leave on this foolhardy quest in the first place. Perhaps he was at home now, waiting and worrying for her sake even as she worried for his.

Adrienna gave a watery smile. “Somehow I doubt I’m that lucky. But you’re right, thanks.” She took the right turn and headed towards the exit. “It’s really strange that you can’t seem to tell me where he is. I mean, you seem to know everything else about me. The location of my betrothed is a heck of a blind spot.”

It was indeed both strange and extremely unsettling.

Adrienna gave a sympathetic glance to the sky, which had taken the place of the ceiling in these conversations. “When I get back, I’ll tell my father’s chief wizard about you. Maybe he can figure out why you are the way you are.”

Or cure Princess Adrienna of her insanity.

“If he tries, I won’t let him. Even if you are a figment of my imagination, which I doubt, you’re still a friend.”

That was . . . very touching, and . . . Adrienna! Adrienna needed to know that she absolutely should not turn that second corner! She needed to stop!

“Wha — ” Stumbling as she tried too late to bring herself up short, the princess rounded the corner and found herself face to face with the Vile Sorceress Villaine.

Villaine stood with her back to the maze entrance, blocking the path to the outside world. Her bat-winged cloak rustled ominously in a breeze that seemed to follow the sorceress specifically for that purpose. An eyebrow crooked in a face stretched like hide drying on a rack. Villaine smiled, and her teeth were very white.

“Leaving so soon, my dear?” the evil sorceress asked.

Adrienna slowly raised her sword in front of her. “A little more warning would have been nice,” she hissed.

The witch smiled more broadly, baring even more white teeth, more than a human mouth should have been able to hold.

“Don’t be too hard on him, Princess. He is a limited omniscient third-person narrator, after all,” Villaine said, stroking something under her cloak. “Though perhaps I should have made the limits more . . . stringent.”

Adrienna lifted an eyebrow, but did not lower her sword. “You know about him?”

Villaine laughed. It sounded like crows descending on a corpse. “Of course. I made him,” said Villaine.

“Made him?” Adrienna asked.

Made him?

Villaine sighed. “It seemed so elegant. You were both to go insane, you see. You driven mad by his endless redundant prattle. He driven mad by his inability to touch you, help you. He, who so loved stories, now forced to tell your story, but never be a part of it.”

Adrienna stared, then her eyes widened. “Oh no,” she whispered. “No no no no.” Adrienna’s eyes were drawn slowly, almost unwillingly, away from the witch and up towards the sky. “Albron?” she whispered.

Albron. Could it be? Could the voice have been that of her lover all along?

The witch smirked and pulled what she had been holding out from under her cloak. It was a small, square book, bound in red leather. Printed in embossed gold leaf on the cover was the title, Said the Princess. The witch opened the book to the last page. Words were printing themselves out on the paper, adding themselves to the last line.

The princess could just barely read the words from where she stood. “The princess could just barely read the words from where she stood” said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book said the book . . .

“Albron! Snap out of it!”

Whoa. That was . . . dizzying.

Villaine sighed again and flipped through the book’s pages. “You were supposed to be helpless. He was supposed to be doubly so. I never expected you to be able to make use of his predicament in this way.”

Adrienna shrugged. “Well, Albron always said that knowledge is power.”

Villaine closed the book with a snap. “Knowledge is good,” she said. Villaine held the book up in one hand, and brought the other hand just beneath it. She clicked the fingers of her free hand together, and tiny flames leapt from the tips. “Fire is better.”

Villaine brought her burning fingers closer to the book, and the flames licked at the cover. The edges of the pages began to blacken and smo — Ow. Ow. OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW OW . . .

“Stop it! Stop hurting him!” cried Adrienna OW OW OW.

“As you wish,” replied the EVIL OLD HAG OW OW OW AH . . . ah . . .

Ah . . . The . . . the witch pulled the flame away from the fragile tome. The pages stopped smoking, though the edges were still singed where the fire had touched them.

“Albron! Honey, are you okay?”

Albron was in better shape than Villaine would be if he ever got his hands on that sadistic  harpy.

Villaine wagged a finger at the book. “Now, there’s no need for name calling, young man,” she chided. “Besides which, you don’t have hands, so I’d reconsider the wisdom of making threats in your position.”

If the little red book were a thesaurus instead of a storybook, it would have been filled entirely with synonyms and alternate phrasings for the words “Go to Hell.”

“Albron, don’t antagonize her!”

Villaine waved the book at Adrienna. “Now, are you going to be a good girl, or am I going to have to do some rather ruthless editing?”

Adrienna scowled. “What do you want, Villaine?”

The sorceress smirked. “I want you to go back to your tower. I want you to grow old there, listening to his voice in your head, until you forget his voice was ever anywhere else. I want this . . . ” she gestured to the book “ . . . to end with the words ‘then she died alone and forgotten.’”

Adrienna stood a long moment. She sagged.

She could not possibly be thinking of giving in.

“Albron . . . ”

She had come so far, and freedom was within her grasp!

“You are in Villaine’s grasp.”

Surely Princess Adrienna was not planning to throw her life away for a book!

“Well, it’s a really good book!”

Adrienna didn’t even like books!

“I love this one!”

It was badly written! Stories were not supposed to end this way!

Adrienna looked as if she were about to cry. She started to lower her sword when . . . s . . . su . . . suddenly . . .

Suddenly . . .

Suddenly King Gervail’s cavalry appeared and they stormed through the entrance to the maze in a clash of spears and hoof beats like thunder, and sunlight flashed off their armour like lightning and the storm descended on Villaine with a blizzard of blows and the court wizards flanked them and made a series of arcane gestures of stunning complexity and Villaine was turned into a small purple splotch THE END.

Villaine started and turned her head, gaping wildly at the empty entrance.

Adrienna, seeing an opening, raised her sword again and lunged. Realizing there was no cavalry there, Villaine turned back to the princess, but Adrienna went straight for the book, knocking it out of her hand and into the hedge. Adrienna tried to seize the book containing her fiancé, but Villaine got between them. Villaine’s eyes and hands glowed. Adrienna dodged the fireball that shot from Villaine’s fingers, but only barely.

Adrienna! Addy! The voice was sorry! It tried to do what Adrienna said before, about saying something different and changing the story, and it was so hard, but it didn’t work, and now it was an unreliable narrator and speaking in run-on sentences and what were they going to do?!

Adrienna ducked another fireball. “Albron, it was a good try . . . ”

But now Adrienna couldn’t trust anything the voice said!

Adrienna jumped sideways and rolled to avoid a shower of sparks.

“Her highness really doesn’t have time to talk you through your little identity crisis right now,” Villaine snarled.

Suddenly large rocks fell from an undetermined location!

Villaine ignored the voice’s ineffectual babbling and continued stalking Adrienna.

Suddenly a bolt of lightning struck Villaine down!

Suddenly a crowd of rabid lawyers appeared demanding compensations on behalf of all the people Villaine had ever turned into toadstools!

Suddenly a crowd of angry librarians appeared to chastise her to death for her careless and irreverent treatment of literary works!

Suddenly a maimed and furious bat-winged frog-griffin accompanied by one other member of its pack hopped towards them from somewhere in the depths of the maze!

Adrienna’s eyes widened.

“Oh, please. As if I’m going to fall for that twi —” said Villaine, shortly before she was knocked to the ground by the angry frog-griffins. For real.

The tongueless frog-griffin Adrienna had injured hopped towards her, eyes crazed. Adrienna positioned herself so that the stumbling sorceress was between her and the beast. The frog-griffin hopped right on top of Villaine, senseless of any existing loyalties in its mad quest to reach the one who’d hurt it.

Gasping for air, the sorceress stretched one glowing hand from under the slimy bulk of her own creature. She reached out, and Adrienna saw to her horror that she was aiming for the book, where it hung caught in the brambles of the hedge.

“NO!” Adrienna screamed, and weaving around the whipping tongue of the other creature, she brought her sword down with all her considerable strength on Villaine’s hand.

The sword sliced through the hand as if it were naught but air, severing it at the wrist. The hand burned away to ash, while the stump now glowed and smouldered. Villaine, crushed by the weight of her own monster, was unable to draw breath even to scream as the trapped spell retreated back up her arm. There was a sickening puff of smoke. Then all sign of struggle ceased.

The bat-winged frog-griffins froze and looked startled, one with his tongue dangling halfway out of his mouth. Then, slowly, the creatures began to fade away, going transparent before disappearing altogether. Adrienna looked at her sword. It was shrinking away to nothing, pommel and tip growing ever closer until it blinked out of existence with a soft sigh. Two soft sighs, one could almost imagine.

A look of wild hope came into Adrienna’s eyes, but as quickly faded.

“You’re still narrating.”

Adrienna turned to the hedge. There, sure enough, was the little book, unchanged. She plucked it from the brambles and cradled it gently. Her fingers traced the letters on the cover.

“Oh, come on! How is that fair?”

It was not fair, at all.

“All her other enchantments were broken — her creatures, the sword. Why are you still a book?”

The voice was stumped, and more than a little miffed, if truth were told. Perhaps it was because this spell was cast more recently, and thus harder to break.

“I don’t suppose you have an index, or an appendix?”

Hey! That tickled!

“No, there’s nothing written here that you haven’t already said out loud.”

And they all lived happily ever after?

“Nice try.”

Well, the voice was out of ideas. This was a thoroughly unsatisfactory narrative. When Lord Albron had been human, this would probably have been the sort of depressing modern yarn he would have tossed back on the shelf in disgust and never read again. Not only was he a book now, he wasn’t even a good book.

“Hey, don’t be so down on yourself. You’re interesting! Lots of magic and sword fights and things! And you’re . . . printed on very high quality stock!”

But it was all wrong! This sort of story was supposed to end on a rousing high note, with a wedding or a parade or at least a kiss.

Adrienna froze, staring at the words on the page. “This sort of story . . . ” she breathed. “Could it really be that simple?”

Hardly daring to breathe, she held the book up to her face, as if she were nearsighted. Closing her eyes, she brought the last page to her lips —

 

 

“Wha . . . Adrienna? Oof!”

“Albron! Thank goodness! Thank goodness it worked! Thank goodness you always read those blasted stories out loud to me, and I’ll never complain again!”

“Addy, honey, I can’t breathe . . . ”

“Sorry. No, not sorry, you deserve it. The hug and the hurt. Dummy.”

“Love you too. But seriously, I have ribs again, and they’re cracking . . . ”

“And they all lived happily ever after.” <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> The Stories She Tells Herself
by Kelly Sandoval
He stole her skin. Yes, that’s the one. He stole her skin, so he had her heart. Or her soul. The part of her that would have fought him otherwise.


She remembers the before. A life that tasted of salt and crunched between her teeth like fish bones. She shared the waves with her sisters, and they were fierce, the lot of them. What was a second form when measured against the chilly caress of waves and the laughter of her siblings?

But she liked to wander. She liked the feeling of her skin as she peeled it off, the sharp, painful tug of it. The sounds it made, the wet noise of separation, made her shiver. Without her pelt, she was pale and unpleasant, all frail, pathetic humanity. Gone was the muscle and weight of her true form, gone were teeth made to tear raw flesh from bone.

She felt like a fish, all brittle scales and no coral to hide in. There was an allure to such vulnerability. The day he found her, she’d hidden her skin in the shadow of a boulder and gone walking where the water met the rocks. The wind stung her eyes and her fragile human skin. She rubbed the raised flesh of her bare arms, glad at the life she didn’t have to live.

Until he took it. She felt him pick it up. The stomach twisting shock of an unfamiliar hand stroking her pelt. The tug, right at the core of her, drawing her toward him.

He was tall, soft looking, with a long black coat and an easy smile. He draped the coat over her bare shoulders and pressed his warm, wet mouth to her neck. She let him. Let him lead her, unresisting, back to his house. Her house too, he told her. He didn’t ask her to marry him. He didn’t ask her anything at all.

That night, after he had finished, he stroked her back while she shook.

“Don’t worry,” he said. “You’ll do better next time. I’ll teach you.”

“I’ll try,” She dug her nails into her palms and the sharp shock of pain made her breath come easier.

He tugged at a dark, coiled strand of her hair. “Tell me you love me.”

“I love you.”

He had her skin.

The skin is a distancing device, isn’t it? A way of saying, you see, she had no choice. It was only ever him.

Perhaps he was a monster. Golden eyes and blood on his breath. She knew it from the moment she met him. She could see it in the shape of his smile, in the too tight way he squeezed her hand. And still, when he offered to walk her home, she agreed. Hunger, she thought, was better than apathy. At least he wanted her for something.

She found she enjoyed his attentions. He whispered to her of eternity, of beauty never fading. She wondered if he expected her to believe him.

There are girls who fight monsters. And girls who become them. And then there’s the girl who lays, still and broken, when the movie opens. Maggots crawl out of her open mouth as the camera pans across her bare skin. Someone vomits. The opening credits roll.

She knew which girl she was.

But monsters are patient. He walked her home, just as he promised. He didn’t ask to come in, and she didn’t invite him. And just so, the next day, and the next. He listened to her problems, her worries, her hurts. He didn’t argue, or offer solutions. He agreed with her. Yes, she was too fragile. Yes, she was boring. Yes, it was true that her friends probably hated her. But he had time for her. He forgave her all her faults.

She thought it must be love, the urge to always say yes to him.

It happens that way. One day, you’re walking home with a monster. The next, you can’t remember why you ever distrusted him. You open the door. The story ends poorly. It’s best to tell another.

Let’s say she bought him in a store. An artificial lover, wrapped in cardboard and plastic, like a child’s doll.

She found him in the clearance section. Discontinued models, no refunds or returns. He looked so harmless. Warm brown eyes, crooked teeth, a softening mid-section. Here was someone who might love her. Clever, said the box. Experienced. Good for self-improvement.

She just wanted something safe. She wanted to be able to say, Here, look, I am loved. Doesn’t that mean I’m okay?

When she first got him home, she couldn’t bring herself to wake him. What if she’d chosen wrong? What if he was disappointed? A boyfriend from a box was still a boyfriend. There were rules she didn’t know. And she liked to know the rules.

She took a shower. Cleaned the house. Read the instruction manual. The sun was setting when she took his right hand in hers, just as the instructions said. The hand was cool, but the skin felt almost real. When his fingers squeezed hers, she couldn’t tell that it was metal, not bone, beneath their surface.

He opened his hand and stretched in his box. Then he looked at her, warm brown eyes with nothing behind them. He smiled, and it was exactly the sort of smile it should have been.

She tried to echo it.

“Well,” he said, as he sat up. “What a quaint place we have. And aren’t you cute? You even dressed up, didn’t you?”

She blushed. He had called her cute. And if that was his job, if that was what was written on the box, he’d still done it.

“Yes,” she said, pleased with herself. “I did.”

He stood, and helped her to her feet. “It’s important that you’re trying,” he said. “Everyone has to start somewhere. And now that I’m here to take care of you, everything will be better.”

He kissed her then, and she ignored the quiet whir of electric motors and the plastic smell of his skin. She imagined that his tongue was not cool and dry as it pressed its way past her lips.

“Do you love me?” she asked him, when he pulled away.

He touched her face, traced the curve of her neck. “I will,” he said. “You have so much potential.”

Remember you were young. Remember, he was not. Remember, stories change.

Once upon a time there was a girl. When she was young, and not yet wise, she wandered into a dragon’s cave and could not find her way out again. The dragon held her with promises, with words, pretty and cruel. He learned her fears and whispered them to her like love songs. He taught her the mantra of her imperfections and she memorized every word.

Walk taller, he said. She held her head up. Kiss me, he said. She burnt her lips on the furnace of his throat. Fly, he said.

“Fly?” she asked.

“Only teasing,” he told her, running a talon down her bare back. “You’ll never fly. But you needn’t worry. That’s what you have me for. You can watch.”

He spread his great silver wings and danced in the wind. She stared up at him, remembering what it was to be powerful and free.

That night, she waited until he slept, and crept into his hoard. She ignored the gold, the gems, the silks and bones. Iron did not shine like treasure, but there were blades enough for her to choose from. She tested each against her palm, selecting the one that drew blood.

She started at his throat, cutting down from neck to groin. The blade slid in easily, the edge blessed for some poor knight’s quest. He woke, while she was still at work. Told her, his voice chilly with disgust, that she would never manage to kill him.

“I’m not trying too,” she said. She could see, already, the man within the dragon. His eyes were gold. His teeth, too sharp. His bones, she knew, were metal. He looked so small, so frail and needing. He cried, as she cut away the last of the skin. Grabbed her hand and claimed to love her. She was young enough to believe him. To apologize. But not quite so young that she stopped.

The skin was sticky with blood. When she draped it over her shoulders, it clung to her flesh like wet fabric. She pressed the ragged edges closed across her stomach and the skin knit itself together, stretching and resettling as it shaped her. She had been small for so long. But no longer.

She stretched her wings, felt the power and grace of her lost self. The air smelled of salt, blood, and freedom.

End it there, in flight. Pretend his memory doesn’t follow. Make it simple. Safe. That’s the thing about stories. They end how we choose. Happily ever after. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> How do you make progress in a world that doesn’t change? You don’t. Every now and then, though, I catch myself thinking about what my life would be like in a different world; one where progress hasn’t been declared an enemy of the people and locked away out of sight and — most people’s — minds.

A world where I could change.

I am a terrible fisherman. I know this, my father knew this, everyone knows

this. I don’t like water, I get seasick and I’m impatient. My market stall always has the thinnest offerings — unless the water had been uncharacteristically calm that day. Yet I am a fisherman by trade and will be one until the day I die. That’s what it’s like on the islands, where you are no more than what you were born to be.

Even the royals have no say in the matter.

For as long as we have known, a single family has ruled the people of our secluded, water-locked nation. Brother marries sister to keep the bloodline pure, and their offspring do the very same. There is, and has only ever been, one royal family; nobody new ever takes power. Nothing ever changes. Their only threat is the randomness of nature. A brother and sister have been known to produce only male or female heirs, which is a problem. Famously, a King and Queen of two-centuries past had eight sons. Their sons then had to be tasked with fathering a pair of siblings; a new King and Queen capable of carrying on the family line. A difficult task without a sister.

It was a worrisome time for our people, but with the help of aunts and nieces, the reign of the family continued. Insurance policies are always in place, of course; extra sons, daughters and cousins standing by to take up the mantle, should the current monarchs die or prove baron. It’s all the same blood, after all.

It may sound strange, but the system works. We are an affluent nation. A nation of stability. A stability that comes from a foundation of knowing that we all have a part to play; that we all have our jobs to do. If we were to change that, if we were to inspire progress, that foundation would be ripped from beneath our feet, and we’d end up like the unstable nations ruled by an ever-changing roster of royals and military leaders on the mainland.

At least that is what the royals claim.

So when I was born to a fisherman, I was to be a fisherman. To take his place when he retired. To keep the wheel turning without ever going faster. While I’m not an only child, my brother could never take over from me. The older child takes the father’s profession, the younger the mother’s. No trades; no exceptions. If a child dies, you have another to replace them. You must have two children - replacements - but you must never have more than that. One child for one parent.

Sadly, my family briefly had three children. My mother fell pregnant by accident. They prayed and prayed that the baby would be needed elsewhere. Sometimes a mother or father will die, then their offspring will die before they can carry on the family profession and keep the economy in its fixed position. Other times, a man or women will not marry, and have no heir. While most are required to marry and sire by law, as the Gods would have it, there is not always a man for every woman.

So, those women pregnant with a third can offer the child as a replacement for whatever role is unfilled. But when my mother gave birth, there was an abundance of third children and an island of good health. My late sister was drowned before she turned one day old. The grief killed my father and since then I’ve filled his place within the world; replacing him in all that he was. Nobody is unique on the island, we all follow the same path as the one before us, and we all will be followed by a copy of ourselves.

People from beyond our island find this practice very unusual. Not least because women can be warriors while men can be childcarers. In the customs of the mainland, men and women have very specific roles to play. On the islands, anyone can and will be anything, just as long as their mother or father was that before them. They also think it strange our royals marry their own blood. They seem disgusted by the notion. It makes sense to most on the island, those who are happy without progress. And most are that, happy. People have work, people have money, and people have purpose. We stay safe, we stay stable and we don’t go hungry. Visitors say we live on a knife edge, that one day it could all crumble. What if one man breaks rank; one ruler sees a new path?

They’re right, of course, which is why they aren’t allowed to visit often, and why nobody is allowed to break rank. Visitors are not only rare, but are never allowed to stay. We don’t take newcomers to the island. To live here you must be born here. New additions would require new work, new lands, new wives or husbands. That would mean change.

But I had to move forward. I had to.

While others celebrated the life of their ruling class and scoffed at the foreigners for their unusual and seemingly reckless economic and social practices, I yearned to be part of their world. I hated what I did, yet I was trapped without hope nor chance of escape. For anything close to that, I’d need a wife, then a child, then old age. But none of that was on the horizon. The only thing that was on the horizon was the sight of fellow fishing boats as I bobbed across the warm waters, my head spinning, my stomach churning and a pool of vomit slowly floating away from my little one-man wooden vessel. Although I hated my little boat, I did sometimes consider it my last resort — I could just sail away. The punishment for abandoning you duties was worse than you might think, though. All my remaining family would be slaughtered, the gaps left behind would be filled by the servers, a group of people whose profession it was to fill in for those that couldn’t work, be they ill, jailed, injured or dead, until a new draft of newborns could be trained and succeed our roles. There was no way to avoid your service to the island, not unless you wanted to pay a terrible price. Faking your death or getting ‘lost at sea’ was no promise of mercy from the royals either, and our current rulers, benevolent as they claimed to be, were more than ruthless enough to hang a family on unprovable charges.

Tormenting citizens was the only interesting thing they ever got to do.

I was doomed to a life I loathed in a world not meant for me, but then, as I floated along, trying to keep the contents of my stomach very much within my stomach, I was struck with an idea. For the first time in my life, I felt like I’d made progress.

My dream, since I was a boy, was to develop some form of magic. Most of those blessed, or cursed as islanders would say, were born with their gifts, yet on that rare occasion, some found it caught them later in life. Magic on the islands was seen as a dangerous thing. A force for change — a challenge to the ruling class. A threat to our fragile existence. An enemy that must be eliminated.

Those with magic were not killed like the unwanted children, however. Our rulers were too God fearing for that. But, they couldn’t stay here. Magic wielders were shipped to capitals cities on the mainland, places where they were worshipped, not shunned. It was the only way off the island — that or to be an unwanted royal. Too many royals meant a need for more wealth in the monarchy, which meant a shift of wealth distribution across the whole island, which meant change. But you couldn’t kill a royal either. Their blood may be needed. To save on costs, those on the furthest edges of the family were sent overseas too, although they didn’t enjoy the same warm welcome as the magic wielders.

Yet I was not blessed with either royal or magic blood.

Magic was rare, very rare, and those that did possess it had very obvious gifts. You’d find either element-wielders, those that could conjure flames from mid-air or ice from stone, or see-ers, individuals granted visions of the future or distant lands. Both types of magic were easy to test and recognise, and seemingly impossible to fake. Or were they? Of course, there was no way I could feign a jet of fire spitting out of my fingertips, but, as my mind wandered over the horizon, letting more and more fish slip through my net, I wondered if I could work a plot cunning enough to appear as if I’d made a prophecy come to bare.

To me, it was all simple enough. So simple I spent days scolding myself for not thinking of it sooner. One happy result of being stranded at sea most of the day, with a desire to focus on anything other than the choppy waves, was that I had found methods of distracting my mind. Unlike many of my kin, I’d taught myself to read. When you were unable to stand for fear of falling over in a fit of dizziness and nausea, remaining clamped in the corner of your boat with a book was the most appealing option you had. As it turned out, reading was a powerful ally in the world of scheming. I could access knowledge that so few others knew existed. Our library was small but full of history, including plenty of scrolls and even the occasional book on two subjects I found most interesting: magical occurrences, and poisons.  

The greatest prophecies, the ones that never failed to get the see-ers of the island banished, were always tragic in their end result. Death was a recurring theme, but should I claim to foresee the death of my neighbour and they turn up with a knife in their neck, suspicion might just overcome the royal’s fear of magic. I had to be more subtle — and poison, I had discovered, was the most subtle killer of all. I’d read all about the vilest and vicious of poisons. Poisons that could kill with just a drop. Poisons that could kill without a sound or symptom. I had to face a very serious question though:

Was I a killer?

The answer, sadly, was an overwhelming cacophony of no’s echoing inside my mind. I was desperate to leave my life behind, just not at the cost of another. But poison did not always have to kill people. Livestock was just as vulnerable, as were crops and food stores. But the whole thing had to be dramatic. It had to get people’s attention if I were to bewitch the public, inspire hearsay and convince the royals I was a danger to their world. Happily, a few scrolls existed on the art of acting, left behind by a very learned old theatre performer.

So what did the scrolls say I needed for a good performance? A crowd. I chose my location wisely. A bustling market by the water’s edge during a warm summer’s day. People were out in droves. Then I had to make it believable. Candid recounts in the books and scrolls I’d read spoke of how see-ers gripped by powerful foresight would collapse into a heap, muttering inaudible words and contorting their bodies. Finally, I had to follow through. I had to carry on the performance to reel in my audience. The true see-ers would wake in a daze and utter words of prophecy, before becoming unnervingly energised and without recollection of the moments prior, instead, slowly coming to remember their vision over the next few minutes. And so, after a multitude of practices hidden away at home in the dead of night, I began.

A plague was coming, a monstrous plague, I believe my exact words were, before I snapped back to life. It’s hard to know if I did a good job, but those crowding around me seemed alarmed and fearful, which I took to mean that I had followed the old performer’s words well enough.

The acting was the hard part, making the prophecy come to fruition was far easier. Mashing up the glands of poisonous fish and mixing them weeds for added potency was challenging, not least because of the smell, but far less taxing than being a live performer. I concocted a deadly liquid to spread across the lower farmlands in the dead of night. By morning, the crops wilted and began to rot, the poison soaking into their roots and decimating everything it touched.

I was quite surprised by its effectiveness.

Not an hour after sunrise I was taken, strung by the wrists and spread across a wooden wrack, set before the royals. And with that, I achieved what nobody on the island had done for centuries. I progressed. I worked my way out of a hole I could not bare to exist within, and I was free.  <|endoftext|>

I heard a story, once…it was about a powerful magician of sorts. He had 
obtained the power of creation, and as such, decided to craft creatures in his likeness, 
but because his was a power born of Earth, those creatures, which looked human 
enough, were impervious to fires. 
Truth, it was an odd story, but there is more, you see…. Those creatures often 
found themselves in the midst of flames for one reason or another. This led to them to the 
discovery that they were unnatural. Inevitably, they returned to their master asking why 
it was that such an oddity was prevalent.
“Because I have created you. You are not human.” Such were his responses, and 
more often than not, those creatures went mad from learning the truth…hmph, truth.
It is has always been about truth, and perhaps it is why I like this story so. Now, 
here’s my favorite part. One day, that powerful magician found himself chased from his 
home, due to awful practices no doubt, and so he set up a camp. While sitting at the 
campfire, a creature, we’ll say it was a wolf. I am partial to wolves…but that is another 
story for another time.
Anyhow, this wolf attacked, and the magician fell into the fire. To his dismay, it 
did not burn. You see…he, too, had been created, but by whom? He had no way to learn 
such.
Why do I like this story? I like truth. It never plays out the way we expect. It is not 
a pure light. It is not epiphany. No, my, no. 
Often, truth is a dark and murky thing; a veil of sorts, which we must learn to 
wield in ways proper to the culmination of our very own and personal life experiences.
What is my truth? Well, let’s say…death is not the end, and leave it at that.
He calls himself a necromancer
Gaulder ran across the valley of ash enroute to Cormaire’s lair. T’was valley was 
rife with death. Ancient bones, or cinders thereof, remained strewn about the gnarled and 
blackened trees. Puffs of ash kicked up behind the man’s wake.
Cormaire, the necromancer—as he called himself due to his practices involving 
unlife—hid away deep in the valley of ash. His lair, a cave beneath the putrid land, was 
denoted by a wicked entrance. The cave mouth was carved from a lone stone, which 
stood near the center of the valley; a stone chiseled to resemble a disfigured and pear-
shaped head. Rows of teeth lined the maws of the head—the actual entry.
Ducking his head to enter, Gaulder clutched a bundle of gray cloths; an item 
master Cormaire required to create a revenant was ensconced within. Being an apprentice 
meant being a liaison of sorts, and because Cormaire was unable to travel into town—it 
was an unworthy risk to his life—Gaulder ran errands in exchange for knowledge.
The young man in tattered, dark clothing worked his way through the labyrinth of 
stone corridors. Each hallway was alighted by torches perched in sconces. Eternally, they 
burned. Finally spilling into the sepulcher, the apprentice spotted the bent, aging 
necromancer pulling entrails from a recently deceased.
“Master,” Gaulder called.
“Mm?” Cormaire mumbled without giving his attention.
Instead he dumped the viscera into a bronze bucket.
“It was no mean feat, but…I have it,” Gaulder announced with a smile.
“Yes. Bring it into the light.”
Gaulder swallowed hard. The master was neither pleasant to work with, nor look 
upon. Mostly, the man was covered in dark robes. Even with the hood pulled low over his 
face, the wizard exuded power, and a foul odor. Gaulder approached the stone worktable 
where the dead subject lay with chest cavity open.
“Here,” Gaulder whispered, placing the bundle adjacent the body.
Cormaire waved his apprentice off before unwrapping the bundle. Amidst the 
gray cloths was a polished piece of amber the size of a child’s fist. Encased within was a 
dried, angel trumpet flower.
“It was not easy to obtain.”
“Powerful items seldom are.”
“How, how does it work?”
The old man walked around the worktable. A plethora of ancient tomes sat on 
rotting shelves behind him. Candlelight flickered. Cormaire drew back his hood revealing 
deep wrinkles. He smiled like a Cheshire cat; his teeth surprisingly clean. The apprentice 
shuddered.
“Revenants, my boy, are particularly difficult to raise,” Cormaire explained. 
“Firstly, the body must have perished from unnatural causes, and the bloodier the better. 
Next, as you just saw, the entrails, gallbladder, and bladder must be removed. Then, the 
cavity is stuffed with chaff bound in burlap…this is to keep the body dry.
“Now, we prefer as little trauma to the brain as possible, lest our raised be a 
simpleton. Furthermore, I prefer to add multiple adrenal glands. These can be obtained 
from any dead person, so long as they are not overly decayed. Splicing the glands into the 
body is a rather simple task, and it provides our revenant with boundless strength and 
endurance.
“Finally, the dried flower encased in amber is used to tie the deceased’s spiritual 
nature to the aether; the…between, if you will. If this is not done, a revenant will be 
unable to follow the orders of the necromancer–”
Gaulder made the mistake of interrupting by saying, “But, master, the others 
didn’t require–”
The master’s eyes turned fierce. A furrow creased his brow, and his jowls sank at 
the corners. The dread immediately filled Gaulder’s heart. He looked away.
“Are you finished trying to tell your master what you think is correct?” Cormaire 
hissed.
Gaulder nodded emphatically. The necromancer’s demeanor relaxed, and he 
continued his lesson.
“Revenants are refined creatures. They are unlike the boorish zombies, or ghouls, 
which any inexperienced Necromancer can raise. Revenants need a connecting link 
between the world of the living, and the world of the dead.”
“What purpose do they serve?”
“Ah,” Cormaire nodded, approvingly. “A most intelligent question. Revenants 
nearly pass for the living. With the proper series of incantations, this…young thief, here, 
can certainly be mistaken for a drunken ne’er-do-well.”
“And what will you have him do for you?”
Cormaire grinned again.
Stealing immortality
The necromancer worked tirelessly over the corpse. Having recently implanted 
new adrenal glands, and stuffed the body with chaff, the only remaining aspect of the 
physical changes was the addition of the angel trumpet. Gaulder kept his eyes on the 
entirety of the proceedings. For the most part, Cormaire gave few, verbal instructions.
“Man’s connecting link is an unseen force,” the wizard started. “It protrudes from 
the abdomen; four fingers’ length down from the navel to be exact. This force is what we 
all use to read the world around us, and as such, the angel trumpet is placed there.”
Gaulder maintained a focused gaze on the master. “What do you mean by read the 
world?”
“The universe is magic…all of it. The physical body, too. Magic is a delicate 
force, not in that it can be destroyed. No, my, no. It can yet be disrupted. Altering natural 
flows leads to unnatural consequences.”
“Like bringing the dead to life?”
“Aye.”
Cormaire gingerly slid the amber containing the flower amidst the burlap sacks 
containing chaff. Then, he removed the chest retractors from the corpse. After that, he 
went about reconstituting the ribs and sternum. To reform the bones, he created bone 
meal in a mixing bowl. The whole formula consisted of powdered, bovine femurs, 
pinesap, and human blood.
The necromancer placed the bone meal at every severed juncture by way of a 
round tipped horsehair brush. Then, he meticulously wrapped thin, copper wire around 
every area to hold the bones in place. Suddenly, he left the sepulcher through a back door 
behind the rotting bookshelves. Gaulder remained in thought while looking over the 
corpse.
I hope this is worth it. Certainly, this place is a wealth of knowledge, but what 
good is all this knowledge if it does not yield power? Furthermore, what good is power if 
it leaves one in such a state as Cormaire? He is alone, feared, hunted, and quite 
obviously, in fear of the world around him.
His were the mental ponderings of a man with little to lose. Gaulder was only 
twenty-four, but had little use for a normal life. His parents died while he was a boy, and 
he had no other family. What was I supposed to do, become a thief? It didn’t serve this 
man well. He hanged for stealing a belt. Soon, he will serve master Cormaire as a 
creature of the night. I can’t help but think of that story…the man who turned out to be 
nothing more than a creation….
His thoughts trailed away, yet he kept his gaze on the corpse. Candlelight cast 
dancing shadows from the remnants of bones and other tools in the cavernous room. As 
hours passed, and the bone meal dried, Gaulder busied himself with pouring over the 
arcane texts. It was rare to ever see Cormaire doing the same. How old is he now? Two-
hundred something…?
The texts revealed little of which Gaulder did not already know. Mostly, they 
provided detailed rituals for healing. Cormaire simply applied the practices in a 
contradictory way.  If one knows how to heal, he knows how to damage. Other texts held 
incantations for menial magics such as casting spells of fire, or spells which reveal 
peoples’ tracks. Useful for a man of normality, but I am seeking much more than that.
He had not noticed Cormaire’s return. The old man stitched the corpse’s skin back 
together with cat intestines.
“Come here, boy,” the wizard demanded. Gaulder shut the tome and placed it 
back on the shelf before approaching. “Listen to my words, and know them.”
He was never one for repeating himself. “Oh, darkest of rituals….” Then, he 
paused for a moment, his open hands raised on high. “Let it be known there is no final 
resting place. Grave servitude is what I demand.”
The area around Cormaire’s form started to darken. “Take into your form this air. 
It is not wind, but the breath of life; my breath.”
Gaulder cocked his head to the side. For the first time ever, as he had witnessed 
raisings before, he noted an ephemeral tendril slowly emerge from the deceased’s 
abdomen, the place where the flower rested. It gave a subtle, indigo glow. During 
Cormaire’s pause in the incantation, and while the tendril continued to emerge, another 
tendril—one from the necromancer—came forth. It was black as night.
“What was yours to command is now mine—your life, your thoughts, your 
needs.” Still, the space surrounding Cormaire grew darker. It was as though the darkness 
was consuming him. Gaulder scarcely saw his master anymore. He was little more than a 
gritty voice. “Facets of life. Mere reflections of the soul are mine to manipulate. Rise. 
Rise. Rise! I command it!”
At the climax of the spell, the body on the table stirred. Cormaire grew silent, and 
the darkness diminished. Both men’s tendrils returned to their bodies.
“Stand, revenant,” Cormaire demanded. The man came to his feet. “Gaulder?”
“Sir?”
“Did you see it?”
“The connecting link?”
“Naturally,” Cormaire replied.
“I did, Sir. I thought they were going to touch, but….”
“Nonsense. I could not possibly affect his connecting link with mine. I can, 
however, affect the world with my link in a manner which causes the world to affect his 
link.”
“Perplexing,” Gaulder commented. Cormaire shrugged with indifference. “Now, 
you send this monster to secure the life stone from Etmire Abbey?”
“Certainly. He is ready.”
“If I may, master,” Gaulder pried. “I fail to see the need in sending one undead 
thief to steal what can be taken by force with a legion of lesser zombies.”
“Revenant,” Cormaire called, momentarily ignoring his apprentice. “You will 
look into my memory and know this location.”
The old man walked to his creation, placed hands on his face, and brought his 
eyes close to the monster’s. They looked into each other’s eyes for a moment.
“Do you see it?” The monster nodded. “Now, you will look into my memory and 
see the item I require. Do you see it?” Again, the monster nodded. “You will utilize your 
experience as a thief and recover this jewel. Though you were weak and slow as a man, 
you are quick and strong as a monster. Go!”
The revenant groaned and darted out of the sepulcher like a mountain cat. Gaulder 
remained staring at his master, knowing full well that, in time, an answer to his question 
was coming. Finally, Cormaire turned to him.
“It does not do well to bring down a wall to smash a gnat. Subtlety, my boy.”
“I don’t understand,” Gaulder complained. “I wish to…but what good is all this 
power, and what good is immortality, if you are to remain in this dreadful place?”
Cormaire nodded slowly for a moment. He drew back his hood, sat down on a 
wooden chair, and looked up at the ceiling. Gaulder was slightly nonplussed and cocked a 
brow.
“It is often I ask myself such simple questions,” the wizard answered. “Working 
with unlife is not about power…not as misunderstood by so many, who wish to rule 
kingdoms. It is about control, mastery.
“I started on this path many years ago. I cannot recall a time in which I did not 
wield magic, but raining fire upon nonexistent enemies was never my concern. Mine was 
a quest to unravel the mysteries of life and death.
“What dusty tomes I perused in the great library called Lycaeum provided little 
knowledge, yet we have all—or rather those of us who deal in magic—have all come 
across a zombie or two, so I ventured off in search of necromancers. As you no doubt 
have found out yourself, it is difficult to track one down. I found an old man by following 
a ghoul back to his lair.
“This old man, his name was Baulder, was in need of an apprentice, a liaison, if 
you will, into the common world. Over time, many necromancers are hunted down and 
slain by stalwart warriors or priests who claim to aid the forces of good, but what is good, 
really?
“I recall asking Baulder why he worked alone. Because a den of necromancers 
exudes too much power, and whole townships will unite to slaughter them. That is what 
he told me, and that is what you need to know. Certainly, working closely with a 
necromancer has its benefits; raising many undead without the constriction of time, but 
then those items required in doing so are quickly depleted.
“It is simply safer to work alone. We are often calloused individuals anyway. 
Most of us prefer the company of our creations. Necromancers, in general, do not strive 
for power, but control over our own destiny.”
Gaulder scrutinized his master in reverie. “Is this why you seek immortality?”
“In part, yes,” Cormaire replied. “At its core, mine is a desire to create the perfect 
rendition of man; an undead who is not dead…a simulacrum, like the wizard in my 
favorite story. As it stands, these creatures I have made do not question the world around 
them. They have no recollection of lives past, or concerns of the future.
“Gaulder, my boy, what has brought this line of questions?”
The apprentice smiled, shrewdly. “I’m an orphan. All of my family has been 
slain. I have witnessed nothing but death and despair my whole life, yet there is a legacy 
from ages past. By sitting in darkened corners, and listening to those who are unaware of 
my presence, I have come to learn that my own family was comprised of great 
necromancers. There is nothing else for me to do with my life.”
“Yes,” Cormaire whispered.
“Tell me more of this simulacrum.”
“Clean up this mess, and I will tell you.”
Gaulder nodded before busying himself with sopping up blood. While he grabbed 
a bucket with clean water and some cloths, the master related his knowledge of creation.
“The simulacrum is a living being, though composed of pieces of the dead. His 
heart beats, his mind ponders, and his connecting link with the universe allows him to 
bend the forces of intent to his will as does that of the living. Moreover, this creature can 
be altered time and again in any fashion.
“A powerful necromancer can provide his simulacrum with additional organs, 
limbs, inhuman appendages, and anything else imaginable. The problem lays in the very 
essence of living. To clarify; an undead has no soul. It is dead, yet the body remains 
functioning because of the creator’s will and magic. Given enough time, any zombie will 
rot away. Even my revenant will eventually fall to pieces. 
“The simulacrum wields regenerative properties. It is unclear whether it ages, or 
eventually dies from such, but if a living man can attain immortality, why not the 
simulacrum?”
Gaulder wrung out bloody water from his rag before scrubbing down the stone 
worktable. “This is simply about pushing the limitations on man then?”
“Yes,” Cormaire hissed. “I must discover this process, and I must perfect it.”
“To what end?”
Cormaire leaned over in his chair, and rubbed the back of his head. “I cannot 
answer that. It is an ache in my very soul. I simply must do this.”
Gaulder stood still. The wavering candlelight continued casting fiendish shadows 
about the dark lair.
“Have others achieved immortality?” 
“Naturally,” Cormaire replied.
“Where are they? Have you met them?”
Cormaire turned to glare at the apprentice. “No, but it does not do you well to 
question my judgment.”
“Apologies,” Gaulder said. “That was not my intent, master. I am but eager to 
learn.”
“That is enough for now. When the revenant returns with the life stone, we will 
speak more.”
A truth revealed
The revenant returned to the sepulcher in a poor state. Missing an arm, and with 
rotting face, it stood almost ready to keel over. In its remaining hand was an 
unremarkable, gray stone.
“Give it,” Cormaire demanded. The beast ambled over and relinquished the stone. 
Cormaire’s grin shown from under the edge of his hood. “Now, go consume flesh.”
The revenant groaned and left the lair. Gaulder arched a brow while watching the 
proceedings. Cormaire brought the stone near candlelight.
“I had expected some kind of shiny bauble,” the apprentice commented.
“The life stone is named so because it is a piece of the old world; a time before 
man. When the Gods walked the Earth, they did as they pleased, thus altering the world 
around them. They created oceans, and mountains, and creatures. It is said that one God 
grew tired of the company of his brothers, and strove to create life as he saw fit. To do so, 
he crafted a magic stone from his own heart.
“It is just a story, but there is always some truth. This…this stone will most 
certainly do.”
After finishing his recounting, Cormaire placed the life stone on the worktable. 
“Now, the incantation,” he said, gazing at the stone. “It is the one I learned from 
Baulder.”
“Your master knew how to achieve immortality?”
“He knew the spell, but lacked the location of the stone of life. His final 
instructions to me were to find it. I have spent many years in search…all for this very 
moment.”
“I can’t wait to see what happens,” Gaulder remarked, facetiously.
Cormaire furrowed his brow at the apprentice, who only smiled in return. “Will of 
God,” the wizard started with hands raised high. “The will of man.” He paused to close 
his eyes and breathed deeply. “I call upon the forces of eternity. Time, the immaterial, 
and abstract, invade my presence.”
Gaulder stared at the stone. Nothing of note occurred.
“Place the everlasting in my temporary vessel. Let it never come to pass that this 
body will age. Let it never come to pass that this body will waste away.” A moment of 
silence persisted. Still, nothing happened. “Hm?” Cormaire wondered, aloud. He looked 
to his grinning apprentice. “You mock me?”
“Master….”
“What?” Cormaire grumbled, letting his arms fall to his side.
“Did you know Baulder had a son?”
“What are you babbling about?” the master yelled as he approached Gaulder.
“Yes…you were not his apprentice.”
The muscles in the old man’s face twitched with rage. “Explain yourself!”
“Baulder was father to Thaulder, and he, a father to Raulder…I was Gaulder, after 
Baulder’s father, the first necromancer in my family history,” the young man revealed.
Cormaire simply stood there, unable to utter a word, so Gaulder raised his left 
hand waist high and manifested a glowing ball of fire from his fingers. He flung the 
magic at Cormaire. When it impacted, nothing happened.
“You were born of Earth,” Gaulder said, calmly.
Cormaire looked at his form; it was one impervious to fire. Then, he looked at 
Gaulder, and for the first time, noted the family resemblance.
“You are the first simulacrum ever created. I was charged to find my family’s 
creation and see to it that no harm would come upon it.”
“I-I,” Cormaire stammered.
“Do you have recollection of your childhood?”
The necromancer remained silent for a moment then he whispered, “No.”
“Do you recall a time when Baulder was not present?”
“O-only following the ghoul.”
“In your time away from your master, you set the entirety of your life upon his 
goal. This was no…how did you put it? Ah, yes, an ache in your soul. This was your 
mission, and mine is to perpetuate my family’s goal—to walk the Earth as Gods among 
men.”
When he finished speaking, Cormaire dropped to his knees, and stared at his 
hands. Gaulder approached the worktable and reiterated the incantation of immortality. 
With each segment of the spell finished, the stone glowed brighter and brighter blue. 
With the culmination of the spell, the stone’s light surrounded the young man before 
invading his body through the eyes. When he turned to face Cormaire, Gaulder’s eyes 
shone bright blue.
“I am Gaulder, and now nothing will stop me from ruling this world.”
He stood over his former master with clenched fists. Cormaire bowed his head 
humbly, finally realizing he had been chasing himself.

 <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> It was unusually quiet on the old dirt road, even for a brisk morning like today. The occasional swinging palm tree and softly blowing reed was the only movement I could see streaking off on the long path before me — that, the slowly bobbing head of my young mare beneath me, and the churning ocean in the corner of my left eye. It was probably another sacrifice drawing the crowds away from the roads, that or farmer Lezron’s sheep had got out again, and he’d got half the village rounding them up. Although with his new wall, I suspected the sheep probably weren’t roaming the northern hillside. I shivered, and it wasn’t the breeze sweeping in over the towering coastal cliffs that caught me.

I rode slowly, in no hurry to see the ready-to-light pyre, nor hear the echoing screams of another poor soul dragged out onto the shimmering sands of low tide. So far out did they take their prize, that the sacrifice took place halfway to the horizon. Still, it didn’t stop the screams reaching my ears, carried by that usually so welcome sea air. Sometimes I wished they did it closer to the land. At least then it would be hidden below the cliffs, and wouldn’t have to see it, although I dreaded to think what smell would waft over those plunging ridges. But my anxiousness was for nought. I came across the rise that separated my view from the sprawling beach beyond, to see no crowd, nor a human chained helplessly to a pyre. I did see a pyre though, freshly built and towering in the distance. But it stood bare, with no chanting crowd gathered around it. The tide had even started to come in, I must have left late, and its wooden base was becoming ever more consumed by the sea. The waters were quickly advancing on it, stroking its edges and reaching deep into its heart, slipping through every crack and crevice between the planks of wood and pieces of unwanted furniture that made up its ominous form.

This was an unusual sight. A freshly made pyre going unused. What was going on? With a kick of my shin, I veered off the beaten track and skimmed my way across the grasslands, heading away from the coast with increasing speed. My curious mind was drawn towards the temple, the only place I could think the villagers would have gone. It was too early for so many to have beaten me into town, and with no sign of anyone on the roads, the stables packed and the village deserted, they could be nowhere else.

The quickly drying grasslands, beaten down by the summer heat, barrelled on and on over to the horizon. Foreign folk would be forgiven for thinking this place was nothing but barren fields stretching on until it reached the lusher lands many miles away, but they would have been wrong. These flatlands held a secret.

Not long after I left the path, I came to it. Sprawling before me was a deep pit, the size of a small lake. Its edges were dipped below the tall grasses, hiding it from view until you came close to its precarious ridge. A carefully dug pathway, wide as two men, spiralled like the pattern of a snail’s shell, curving around the edge of the giant oval, steeping gently downwards until it reached the floor deep below. The old Fire Stone quarry had been harvested many centuries ago for its sacred gems; gems consumed by the magic wielders of the eastern capitals in their bizarre rituals. Now it was a sight of worship, a sacred hollow. On the quarry floor lay a temple, built from the black stone that lined the walls of the pit.

The temple, circular in shape with a large domed roof and four pointed pillars dotted around its edge — equidistant from each other — had its doors slung open. Inside I could see shadows moving, but heard only muffled voices — the pit was too deep, and the temple too far away, to make out words. I flung myself from my horse and wandered over to the edge of the pit. Walking the spiralling route could take an eternity, so I opted for a quicker path. I scrabbled down the rock face to the first tier of the pathway beneath me. Gripping bits of protruding rock and shimmying my way down the sheer edges, I carefully dropped lower and lower, quickly drawing upon the temple. My hands were blackened, my tatty tanned linen clothes stained too, although it was hard to know where the old stains ended and the new ones began. Some of the drops could be near five metres to the next layer of path below, but this wasn’t my first visit to the temple, and certainly not the first time I’d opted against the slower option. As I drew closer, I could hear the voices more clearly.

Angry voices. Many angry voices.

Hitting the dusty quarry floor hard, letting myself drop the last metre or so in my hurry to find out what was happening, I quickly snuck up to the temple’s encircling staircase, through the doors and in behind the crowd.

Wooden pews curved around the room, the rows centred around an altar that lay at the very heart of the temple. Light poured in through huge shimmering stained glass windows that lined the base of the massive overarching dome. The building was far too big for the needs of the locals, but you didn’t slack on God’s work.

Around eighty villagers stood spread out in the aisles closest to the door, all wearing grim or angry expressions, their attention drawn towards the Father who stood on the raised altar. Robed in dark red garments lined with black embroidery, hooded and adorned with crimson markings on his face, the Father was quite an intimidating sight. He was not, however, an intimidating man.

He was pleading with the grumbling crowd “Please, there is nothing to be done”.

As I took up my place within the agitated mob, a hand caught my own and spun me around.

“What you doing here, girl?” My neighbour, wrinkled old Marken, glared up at me over his crooked nose. Clawing back his long thin, scraggly grey hair, he revealed narrow, disapproving eyes. “This isn’t your place to be.”

“What’s going on?” I ignored his callous tone and sneering expression.

“And you would care, because?” He hissed. I was trying to listen to the words of the Father but Marken’s heavy breathing wiggled its way deep into my ears.

“Just because I don’t have the stomach for your bloodsport, Gremlin, doesn’t mean I don’t care about what happens in my village”.

Marken snarled and shuffled away without another word. As he left, I caught the words of the Father. I couldn’t have missed them this time.

“It is final!” He bellowed, clearly fed up with the crowd. “You have no say. Ignore the decree and you’ll be hung for heresy”.

“It’s a bloody outrage!” called one of the villagers.

“This is the rule of law.” The Father said in authoritative voice before turning in a sweeping motion of his long robe, streaking through the crowd and out the doors of the temple. Tearing after him, I caught the Father as he rounded towards the back of the temple; he walked with such pace I knew he was hoping to escape before anyone did exactly what I did, and chased after him.

“I seek the Goddesses’ blessing!” I called after him. He became rooted to the spot, sighed a heavy sigh and spun around.

His face was dull, tone irritable. “The Goddess blesses you, may yo-” He paused when he finally took the time to actually see who he was speaking to.

“What are you doing here?”

“What is going on?” I approached him as he sat on the steps of the temple and

beckoned for me to join him. As I shuffled to sit beside him, the murmuring crowd could be heard, out of sight, leaving.

“Hawk from the capital this morning.” The Father handed me a small rolled up note clutched in his hand.

“Henceforth, from this day until the death of Our Lady, none shall be sacrificed in the name of Azra, nor shall fire be used as a tool of death.” I read aloud.

“So, no more pyres?”

“It would seem.” The Father said, grimly. Ahead of us, we could see the first of the villagers drudging their way up the path, still clearly squabbling and venting. “Our Lady seems to have taken to the teachings of the older scriptures and elected to eliminate some of the outlying communities more ‘barbarous’ activities.”

“Are you unhappy about this?” I asked, perplexed. There was only one other person in the village who disliked the sacrifices, and it was the man sat beside me; even if he did light the pyre.

“It kept the people united. It was their one act of servitude and it’s been part of the practice here since our ancestors laid down their homes. It will do our people no good. They have little more than tradition.”

“It will do the people they burned some good.” I retorted in an argumentative tone.

The Father shrugged. “True. The town’s jailer won’t be too happy, though. Plenty of coin he’ll be losing”

“Has to actually watch the prisoners instead of burning them.” I laughed.

“I’ve tried to argue that the people could use their money to buy livestock instead, but they’re adamant that the inscriptions depict people, and so nothing less will do.” The Father groaned and rubbed his face with his hands. The crimson markings smeared and came away on this palms. I grinned as he cursed loudly.

“I worry how it will affect them. How they’ll handle it. The word of Our Lady is valuable to them, but the word of God is more so. You’ll have to be my eyes in the village, watch for any strange activity. Not that they’ll do anything with you around.”

“I’ll ask mother to be my eyes for your eyes.”

“Did you not see your mother in the crowd? She was as angry as any of them. Don’t you tell her I’ve got you spying or she’ll be down here to put me on the pyre.” The Father smirked.

“She’d be hung for heresy!” I said, mockingly.

“If I know your mother, she’d still do it.”

 

 

The ramifications of the capital’s decision were immediately felt. When dawn broke over the village the following morning, I threw open the shutters of my attic-bound bedroom to oversee numerous glum and lost souls, wandering about seemingly without direction. I found the whole situation ridiculous in all honesty, sacrifices were held but once every few months, they weren’t a daily occurrence, why should it affect our day-to-day lives? As I tiptoed along the beams that crisscrossed the ceiling on which my makeshift, wall-less, bedroom sat, and swung myself down the ladder to the floor below, I noticed even my mother was still troubled by the events of the day before as well. She sat at the table of our shabby, yet cosy little abode — a small, one-story timber house with little in the way of furniture, save a few cheap wooden chairs, a table, two cabinets and a bed in the corner.

“You okay, mother?” I asked, perching myself on a chair across from her.

She held a vacant stare, looking off into nothingness. A chunk of bread lay in a wooden bowl before her, drowning in a pale yellow broth and surrounded by floating vegetables; a spoon was dipped into the liquid. It seemed untouched.

“Not hungry?”

She pushed the bowl towards me.

“What’s wrong?”

She looked at me with a glare. I could feel her disdain. Mother didn’t usually mind my ways of the unholy, as she would often call them. Just a youngster questioning her surroundings, but I could tell she wasn’t in the mood for my contrarian viewpoints today.

“It’ll be okay,” I said earnestly, reaching my hand out towards her. She took it lightly, her gruff expression softening. My mother had a harsh face — pointed and narrow, with hair scraped back in a tight bun, but her eyes were kind when she wanted them to be.

“I know you didn’t agree with them. But our Goddess demanded it of us. Now we face her justice. Her terrible wrath”. My mother’s voice was wrapped with worry, it was almost shaking.

“But Our Lady is the one who decreed it. The voice of Goddess Azra herself. Surely you can trust her to keep us safe?”

“Rulers can make mistakes, dear child.” Mother replied with a grimace.

By the time the week was out, the village was a very different place. People were on edge, living in constant fear. If something went wrong, a sheep died suddenly, a leak appeared in somebody’s roof, it was an omen; a sign that God was angry, and she wanted what she was due. Prayer wasn’t once a week now, it was every morning and every night. The Father was awash with visitors to his temple. I would catch him, exhausted outside. Sleep wasn’t easy when there was a constant banging at your front door. He was close to cursing the decision, we both were. As much as we hated the barbaric, ritualistic burnings, our friends and loved ones seemed lost without them. The rug had been pulled from beneath them and they were still stumbling about, trying to find their feet. There were anger, tears and sheer bewilderment. The aged in particular were at sea. They’d known this way their whole life, and many now feared for their place in the afterlife. Two weeks on from the change, with the cloud of an imposing God’s wrath still very much floating over the village, the Father called a special sermon.

He spoke from scrolls he’d dug out of his library, hoping their words would bring comfort in these confused times. The Father now spent his days trying to soothe and console people, and his nights searching for answers.

“Your servitude is not born of simple ideal. It is born of true belief, that only you can decide how best to show your faith.’ He said regaling the crowd, a tatty piece of parchment spread aloft before him. He would constantly spin around, talking to all those that surrounded his circular altar. The temple was packed out, as it always was these days.

“Divinity has no right answer, nor wrong answer. Divinity is within your heart. A cruel and twisted heart can still follow the teachings of God.” He continued. “But that heart shall face the holy judgement.”

The Father rolled up the parchment and looked around at the herd of wide-eyed followers. “You hear that? From the world of ancients, a scroll of God’s will. A sacrifice is not what she needs. She needs a pure heart. She needs you to follow your own path to her.”

The crowds began to look around to each other, uncertain of what they were being told. There seemed to be a sort of acceptance, nods of agreements, although the looks of worry were no less obvious. The mood was sombre, for all except two. In one of the back rows, two men were arguing in hushed tones. Inaudible, but clearly heated. They were hunched over, ducked behind the pew in front of them. A loud cough from the Father caught their attention. One of them was the grizzled old Marken.

“Out, both of you.” The Father barked. He’s seemed to have found his voice in this time of crisis. I was impressed.

The two men carried on squabbling as they left the temple, letting the heavy doors swing closed behind them with a crack. The Father carried on trying to abate the crowd’s concerns, yet by the time everyone was leaving, there was no mistaking the unease in the air. Words of comfort might take the edge off, but they were still, in their eyes, angering a being of almighty power. After a long trudge out of the temple at my mother’s side, far ahead of the group behind us — after all the commotion, I was careful to keep my distance — we came across one of the men that had been arguing. He was sat on the dirt-encrusted knoll overlooking the path, waiting for his wife.

“What was that all then?” My mother asked sharply.

“Marken wasn’t taking to kindly to the idea of the Father. I was telling him we have to give him a chance.” the man said, testily. “The bastard wouldn’t shut his mouth all the way up here. Said he was having none of this nonsense. Said he’s going to find his son out eastward. He’s abandoned us. I’m sorry to say gal…” He turned to me “But he took your horse.”

I was so preoccupied with the story that I hadn’t noticed my mare was no longer tied to the post I’d dug into the earth. I’d ridden her down here so I could head to town, and the market, after the sermon. I looked to the floor, saddened. My mother slung her arm around me.

“The old fool will die on the road” my mother replied coldly, “and good riddance.”

She lead me away, back towards the village. My heart was heavy. I rather liked my horse. I’d had her three years. Mother always said don’t get attached. That she was worth money and we had little, but I wasn’t good at listening to my mother on the best of days. Upset, I went to bed early, not getting up even for the heavy knocks at the door or to question my mother when she returned home later than usual. It was unlike her, but the whole community was acting differently at the moment, and I was starting to become disinterested in the whole thing. Now somebody had stolen the only thing I could talk to, and have listen to me without being judged or mocked, save the Father, and I wasn’t in the mood to humour their little tantrum anymore.

But I didn’t have to. The morning brought with it new life to the people. Sleep and the sermon seemed to have helped reinvigorate their spirits. There was certainly still an unease about the air. People were smiling and friendly, as they had been before the decree had reached us, just a bit more timid; a bit more awkward than usual; but a knock like the one they received would do that. I had hope. Hope for a world without sacrifices where our village could live in peace with itself. I took my mother’s horse to town that morning, stopping off at the temple to encourage the Father to keep looking for similar scrolls, that the people were improving. His elation was hide to mask. The effects had been so sudden, so severe, we both worried for the sanity and safety of the villagers, but now, things seemed to be looking up. Even without my own horse, I quite enjoyed the ride to town. It was quiet outside the village, but I knew now it wasn’t because somewhere on the beach below, watching as somebody was being dragged to a gruesome death. People were simply too busy putting their lives back in order after the turmoil of the past few weeks to worry about trade or visits to town.

Town, otherwise known as Clockworth Harbour, was a bustling trading port set in the shadow of some overhanging chalk cliffs. It was the meeting point for many smaller villages spread across the coast, and both the hub of trade coming from the islands beyond the horizon, and also the cities further inland. Clockworth was by far the largest settlement I’d ever visited. A mix of many wooden houses, warehouses, taverns and huts, all connected through muddy streets and encircled by spiked timber fencing, it was not my favourite place to be. It was rough and dirty. If it weren’t so dank I’d have probably moved here years ago. I enjoyed the liveliness, the shouting merchants, crowds of people and worldly curiosities lining the market stalls spread across the entire town, but it lacked the colour I’d grown accustomed too. And the people could be quite… unsavoury. Everything was either brown or grey in this town. Even the sky overhead seem drearier.

I made my way through the crowds, the hoofs of my mother’s large steed sloshing through the mud, heading towards the docklands. Despite their detestment of my heathenistic ways, the village was a bright and kind community when it wanted to be, and they had all banded together to buy me a new horse. A satchel of coins was tied to my waist, and I sought out a trader of mares. I wanted something a bit lighter and gentler than the giant upon which I rode. I found him, by the water’s edge, horses to his left, drinking from the shallows or wading in through the water, and bales of hay to his right. He paid no attention to me as I drew closer, instead focusing on a carving he carefully scored with a threatening looking blade.

Dismounting, I rounded on the horses for sale. One, in particular, had caught my eye. The moment it saw me, it wandered over, caught a few feet away by the rope attached to its front leg. This was my horse, my mare. Gently stroking her, I shot a glare over at the trader.

“Where did you find this horse?”

“Wandering the fields south of the town border.” He replied in a dry tone, his gaze remaining fixed on his carving. “50 coin, 55 with a saddle.”

“This is my horse,” I said forcefully, untying the rope bound tightly to her leg.

This got the trader’s attention. He rose quickly, leaving the carving but keeping his knuckles firmly gripped around the handle of his blade. He approached me, brandishing the knife. His face was splattered with dirt, as were his ragged old clothes. His bent nose, cold stare and crooked lip didn’t inspire much warmth. He stood over me, outmatching my stature by two foot or more.

“This is my horse,” I repeated strongly, looking up at him, although my nerve was starting to break.

The trader leaned in, his dark and beady eyes locked with my ever more timid stare. “50 coin, 55 with a saddle.” He repeated, harshly. Pausing, he looked me up and down. “How old are you?”

“Fourteen” I replied proudly, still holding my tone.

The trader grinned a half-toothless grin. “Maybe we can work out some other way for you to pay for my horse.”

He stroked the side of my neck, before moving his hand lower, trying to drag the corner of my top off my shoulder. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, I shuddered as he moved his hand down my arm. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.  

 

 

I rode mother’s steed back to the village, my mare trotting happily alongside us, kept close by a length rope tied loosely around her neck. I wasn’t going to pay five coin for a saddle, even if my own horse did cost me 50. On the road home I came across the man who had argued with Marken shortly before the old bastard had stolen my horse. He seemed aghast at the sight of me.

“I thought we sent you to buy a new horse!” He boomed, laughing, as I sidled up beside him.

“The trader found her near the water by Clockworth. Refused to hear that she was mine, had to buy my own horse!” I spoke with annoyance in my voice, but in truth, I was just happy to have her back, and happier I’d been able to pay for her with coin.

“Least she’s home now, ay?” He replied with a smile.

Continuing on to the village, I was glad he’d taken the news so well. I was worried that the villagers would be angry to hear their coin was spent on a horse that already belonged to me, especially since we weren’t exactly the wealthiest of folk. I was tempted by another mare, simply to avoid such problems, but I couldn’t be without her, not when I knew she was mine to be had. Surprisingly, the mood amongst all those I came across was decidedly similar. They were all very much surprised to see me back with the very mare I’d been robbed of, but seemed pleased all the same. I was almost taken aback by the niceties, surely somebody was bothered by the whole affair? I suppose the Father’s words of twisted hearts must have been ringing in their ears. If they couldn’t appease God through sacrifice, they were determined to do it through kindness. Not that I was complaining. People were being far friendlier towards me than they ever were before. I was even starting to feel a bit less like the black sheep by the time I reached home, after stopping for the twelfth time to explain my story to bewildered passersby. Maybe they thought, now the killing had stopped, they could bring me back towards the righteous path. I was tempted, I had to be honest. I never considered myself a non-believer, but their practices went beyond the bounds of my disposition; and my stomach.

Dinner with my mother wasn’t our usual muted affair. I felt like talking, so much running through my mind.

“But why wouldn’t he sell her? I mused as I chewed through a lean leg of lamb. Meat was not something we enjoyed often in the village, but the spirits of the farmers had been so uplifted by the Father’s discovery that they’d given everyone a piece of their recent slaughters. The generosity of the people seemed to be overflowing since yesterday’s sermon.

“He was an idiot.” my mother replied curtly. “Don’t dwell on it my girl, just be thankful you got her back”.

“Yes but…” I continued. “To find her out on the road like that. It meant he rode her to Clockworth, I assume to catch a ride to the islands, and just left her. Surely he wasn’t that daft? He rode off with nothing but the clothes on his back, he’d have needed money.”

“It appears he was that daft” Mother retorted, leaning over the table to ladle some more broth. “Enough of this chatter, I detest talking about that creature.”

“The village seems very happy,” I remarked, changing the subject — still eager to talk. “The Father really woke everyone to the idea of a more merciful God, didn’t he?”

“She is as she says she is. We follow her guidance and hers alone” Mother replied, almost chanting. “Her word is law.”

I should have figured it out then, but I didn’t.

Like a half-wit, I carried on believing all was well. I went to sermons frequently, got involved in the community more and became a part of our thriving little village. Everyone seemed happy; everything seemed like it was right. It was three months on when things started to take a turn. People were becoming distant again; agitated. There seemed to be a cloud hanging over us once more. Nobody said it, nobody bored the crowds with their fears of impending judgement and wrath, but it sure felt the same as before. Everyone started to behave weirdly. My mother would pace around the house. Not in the house. Outside the house. Late into the night, wandering in circles. I’d wake in the morning to find her asleep on a stack of hay leaning up against the wall. When I asked her what was going on, she evaded, mumbled and trailed off. I pressed her, tried to call her out on her obvious avoidance tactics, but she was a stubborn little barb, my mother, push too far and she’d sting you hard. After about a week, I woke to find her asleep in her bed. Nestled up, all cosy in the corner of our single, open room. Wrapped in a blanket, she looked quite content. That morning the village was back to its chirpy self. The clouds of unease faded, and people got on with their lives like they had before. It was as if nothing had ever bothered them at all. I was well and truly puzzled, for all of three days. Then it hit me; pretty damn hard.

Swinging the door open at the crack of dawn, on my way down to the coast to hunt for crab meat and search for herbs from the cliff walls, for which my mother, the local chemist, would use to make sleeping drafts and drinks to soothe pain, I was knocked aside by one of the villagers as he walked past carrying a crudely constructed wooden coffin. I hit the wall of my house with a thud, much to the surprise of my assailant, who peered over the box supported on his shoulder.

“Sorry, my dear girl!” The coffin bearer cried, carefully laying the clearly empty item beside him before rushing over to help me up.

“It’s alright,” I said, brushing myself off whilst eying up the coffin. “Who died?”

“Poor old Widow Millio.” The man replied, solemnly. “She’d been sick for some time now, but gave the last of her strength last night.”

“That is a shame” I replied softly. The widow had a bright heart. She’d never been a fan of my heretic ways, but recently we’d grown closer, now I had joined the true path, as she called it. Yet, it was odd. I had seen the woman not five days prior and she was in perfect health. A sudden turn was not unheard of for her age, but surprised me all the same. As myself and the coffin bearer wandered off in different directions, I was caught by a sudden thought.

“How did you get that made so quickly? The markets won’t be open yet.”

“Oh, we put it together this morning.” The man seemed startled by my question. He turned sharply, nearly dropping the coffin. “They want a burial as soon as possible.”

“I didn’t think we had a carpenter in the village?” I pressed, puzzled.

“No.” The man responded awkwardly, pausing for a moment. “We… we just had a go ourselves, me and a few of the farmer’s lads.”

“Oh.” It seemed a strange thing to do, but it wasn’t exactly the sharpest or finest of coffins. “Well, good job not waking me! I’d have thought those hammer blows would have carried over the entire village.”

The man gave a stunted laugh before turning on his heels and walking in the opposite direction. But where he moved away, I stayed rooted to the spot. Working over what had just happened in my mind.

The next thing I knew, I was hammering on the door of the temple. Locked this early in the morning, I was met by a sour-faced Father, who edged the door open a hair to peer out and see who it was. Noticing it was me, he let it swing open and, with a yawn, perched on one of the wooden pews. He was draped in his usual robes, but not yet managed to put on the full makeup. He looked bleary-eyed and impatient. He gestured for me to get on with it.

“They’re sacrificing each other.” I blurted out, unable to put the words in a better order in my mind.

“What?” The Father asked with a raised eyebrow, seemingly amused.

“Widow Millio, she’s dead.”

“They told me she was sick. I was due to see her this morning. Very unwelcome news, but I think you’re stretching.”

“The day after Marken disappeared, everyone was happy again.”

“I gave them a reason to be,” retorted the Father, resentment in his voice.

“They found my horse running in the wilds. Why wouldn’t he sell it?

“He wasn’t the smartest of people, Myah.”

“Listen to me. Marken disappears, the village is happy. Three months later, around the time of sacrifice, everyone gets edgy. Then, everyone is happy again. Then, suddenly, Widow Millo is dead of sickness. The farmers apparently built a coffin this morning, without the knowledge or tools. Without waking the entire village hammering nails into solid wood.”

“Coffins aren’t exactly the toughest thing to build, and they probably just made it slowly. Marken’s leaving was a pure coincidence. The village was edgy because it was the usual time of sacrifice, but nothing bad happened, again, and they realised it was going to be okay, again” The Father was clearly not interested in what I was saying, rubbing his tired eyes and speaking dully.

“You’re a fool,” I shouted, marching away and slamming the door behind me. Quickly I peered back around it for one final remark. “Who do you think’s next, ay? How about the heretic girl, or the Father who opposed their values of worship?”

Angrily I marched up the curving quarry path, but by the top, the anger had abated, and I was just scared. I was alone in my thoughts. The Father would be the only one who would ever believe me. Without him, I was truly without a chance of stopping whatever the villagers were doing. I needed his help, but what could I do? Surely I would be a target. Maybe not the next victim, but if they did this every few months, eventually it would be between me and somebody else, and I would lose. The Father was in danger, too. As much as he participated in the sacrifices, he constantly voiced his concerns about them and his desire to have them ended. He was also a man of faith and wouldn’t question the orders of those who claimed to be the voice of God. I could see them thinking us both a threat. But which was more?

Time passed as it did before. A period of happiness and contentment, but I was wary this time. The smiles, the generosity, were they just luring me in for an easy kill? Again, as expected, as we drew ever closer to the usual time of sacrifice, the mood darkened, although not quite as bad as before. I was nervous, a sense of foreboding hung above my bed every evening, as my mother trotted around the house into the dead of night. Seemingly waiting for something. This time though, I was awake with her. I watched her, through the cracks in the wooden-panelled walls, as she’d circled the house. Then, without warning, she was gone; failing to make her usual pass by my room. I quickly scrambled out of bed, slid out the door and was away into the night.

Catching sight of her wandering off through the village, arms crossed, elbows-dug into her sides anxiously, I followed. I had to be careful of my footsteps on the dirt, stone and twig encrusted path below, she wouldn’t be happy if she caught me. She was heading for a flickering light atop of a gentle hill in the distance; where farmer Lezron kept his sheep. The outline of the dark horizon was just visible in the moonlight. My mother wasn’t the only one moving towards the hill. As a door in front of me creaked open, I quickly leapt behind a market cart sat chained to the house. With more footsteps behind me, I crept around the gap between the wall and its wooden frame, peering out into the night, hidden from view. Dozens of villagers were heading up towards the flickering light, knocking quietly on doors and whispering to others.

“It’s time.” I heard one say.

As the village masses congregated on the hillside, I managed to slip in behind the last of the crowd and follow them up the pathway, through the lines of houses of our unassuming little village, towards the top of the hill. Between the village and the open pasture of the hillside was a low-lying and jagged stone wall. After watching the last of the villagers hop their way over a particularly low section of it, I edged my way over and crouched in its shadow.

There they all were, nearly every member of the village, save the youngest children. They gathered around a lone tree bathed in the light of two flaming torches hanging from its branches. They encircled the tree, kneeling before it. Once the final person took their place, neck bent low before the tree, low-mumbling broke out — soft chanting. Suddenly, a hand caught my shoulder. I leapt up with a jolt, heart pounding, to find myself beneath the towering and daunting figure of the last person I wanted to see.

“You followed me,” my mother grumbled.

“You wouldn’t tell me what you were doing” I barked back, still trying to catch the breath she’d just torn from my lungs.

“Because you wouldn’t understand.”

“What are you doing here?” I asked, unable to hide my suspicion, the pitch of my voice rising.

“We’re praying to God. Asking for forgiveness for our crimes. Asking for forgiveness for abandoning her teachings and following a false idol. The Father told us to make our path so we are, we denounce the Voice of God and send her our own.”

“You’re killing people, again?”

“No. The Father won’t allow it.”

“So why didn’t you tell me what you were doing?”

“Because the people still don’t trust you, Myah. They’re taking you in, but they need time before they can believe you care for them like they care for you. And if you were to tell others of our denouncement of God’s Voice, we’d all be hung same as for sacrificing.” My mother’s gaze was fierce, her voice stern.

“Now back to bed before anyone sees you and panics.”

Without a word I turned tail and walked away. I didn’t want to people to be fearful, not now they’d found a way of coping. Who cares if they denounced some supposed prophet in a palace miles from here? As long as they stopped killing people, I was happy. No more screams, no more subtle scents of burning flesh gently wafting over the clifftops. But then something caught my eye. In the light of stars, down an alleyway peeling off to my right, I caught sight of what looked to be four men, walking through the darkness, each holding a corner of some sort of box. It was the length of the man and perhaps as deep as a small child. They were heading in the opposite direction to me, up towards the hilltop and the crowd. I spun around and headed back for the flickering light, peeking out from the corner of a house to watch them. As they reached the wall they clambered over it carefully. The front two men went first, taking the weight of the box, before the two behind swung their legs over to join them. The box bumped against the stone wall as they went, and, as it did so, let out a metallic rattle.

The still-kneeling crowd shuffled apart as the troupe reached them, making a narrow path between which the men could walk through. Reaching the base of the tree, they carefully placed the box upright, so it stood just taller than they were. From the crowd, a man stood, while those carrying the box took up their place kneeling beside their kin — all except one, who remained rooted beside the tree. This man was cloaked in a long robe. I couldn’t see his face but I knew who it was. So taken by the events, or perhaps muddled by the darkness, I hadn’t noticed the Father helping to carry the box up the hill. The one who had risen seemed to lean over a woman at the front of the crowd. Stopping, I think he kissed her on the forehead. He then approached one of the flaming torches and unhooked it from the branch, before slowly taking up a place before the box. In the light of the flames, I could see that it was open and hollow, filled with hay, grass, sticks and other bits of wood. On either side of the interior, there appeared to be a chain about waist height, with some sort of metal band attached to the end of it. The man stood motionless for a moment, I could see his shoulders moving with heavy breath. Eventually, he turned to face the crowd, handing the torch to The Father beside him.

“In the light of Azra, I give myself to her and the flame. I give myself so my wife may eat, so my children may grow old.” His voice was harsh but quaking. I could hear the fear in it. It carried its way down the hill to me in the breeze, clear as anything. The Father handed him a vial of liquid, which he gulped down quickly, before taking out what seemed to be a long cloth that had been buried in his legwear. Slowly, he wrapped it around his face, covering his mouth. It then dawned on me what the wrap was for - so the sleeping me wouldn’t hear the screams. He stepped inside the box and shuffled around to face the crowd, bits of hay and grass falling onto the ground in front of him as he moved. He placed his hands in the bands locked to chains either side of him, rattling the links as he did so. The Father, one hand still gripping the torch, snapped a clasp shut on both of them, sealing him in place. Slowly, the Father moved behind the box and lowered it, gently, until it lay on the ground; the man no longer visible. He held the flickering fire overhead, then dropped it in.

I stifled a gasp as I watch the flames immediately flick up into the air. Flecks of fire-encrusted wood spitting up from the already roaring blaze. The fire went up fast, it was likely the box had doused in some kind of hard-liquor from town. The man inside was clearly writhing in pain, the box shook from side-to-side violently. Then, as the fire started to consume the surrounding wood, it fell still. I watched on, in horror, as the fire softly crackled, flames licking up into the air in a gentle breeze. The people of the village simply knelt as one of their own burned before their eyes; watching as smouldering ash drifted away into the night.

 

 

I lay in bed, eyes wide, as my mother crept in and swiftly fell asleep, her low-rumbling snores making me ever more angry with each peaceful inhale. This was the third time they’d taken one of their own. Tomorrow, they would all be happy again. Beaming sweetly, offering me bread and asking about my afternoon. The thought of facing them disgusted me. That man was so afraid. Yet, then another thought swam into my head: he was also so willing. He gave himself without hesitation. He gave himself because these people cannot stop.

In the morning, I found myself yet again at the doors of the temple. I’d rushed passed all those gleaming faces; faces I’m sure turned sour the moment I passed. Wondering if my cold shoulder and pace to get out of the village meant their secret had been discovered. The Father opened unbarred the door to my scowl, and immediately knew what I was there for.

“How long have you known?” I demanded, forcing my way past him.

“I didn’t know about Marken.”

“But Millio?”

“Yes,” He nodded, shamefully.

“But if you burned her, why the coffin?” It seemed an odd question, out of the many in my head, but it shone brighter than the rest.

“Cover our tracks. From you, from any passersby or whispers”.

“I thought you wanted an end to the sacrifices?”

“Oh, I did. I do. To throw the fire on Dullan like that, to watch his eyes scream out pain

that no sound could ever convey, is something I will take with me until I die.” The Father breathed out heavily. “But the people will not stop, Myah. This is their way of life, it always has been, and it always will be. They will die for it. You saw that last night, and you will see it if we’re ever discovered. But they are prepared to hang, rather than risk God’s wrath. God’s wrath is eternal, and when eternity is on the line, nothing more is to be considered.”

I crouched down, my head full of thought. I felt like the screaming that should have come from that burning box was now coming from my own mind. I didn’t know what to do.

“Why don’t they just keep buying more from the jailor, then?

“Too risky. The jailor is a man after coin, he’d sell us out… Are you going to keep the secret?” The Father’s voice was a welcome break from my own tortured head, but it was not much easier to hear. I didn’t know, I didn’t want to answer. How could I stand by, knowing the villagers were burning each other? But if I ratted them out, they’d all be killed. My mother too. My mind then fell onto my mother. What if she were to be chosen, or offered herself, as a sacrifice? Next time, the time after that, or five years from now? There were only so many people in the village. Only a finite pool from which to pluck the next to serve God. Silently, I rose and left. The Father watched after me silently at the door, as I slowly made my way up the path. I had to make a choice. I had to act. But what that act was exactly still eluded me. I had time to think though, time to ponder. Three months, in fact.

“Do not tell them I know,” I called back, just as the Father was shutting the door. He gave a firm, silent nod.

 

 

I wasn’t back in that temple for quite some time. Not, in fact, until the next period of sacrifice. Again, I knocked on the door early in the morning, before most were awake, but what greeted the Father was far from the ordinary. I stood before him, the reigns of my horse in hand, a man slung over the saddle above me. The horse trader, the man who had tried to take my body as payment for my beloved mare, lay in a crumpled heaped, tied to the horse he had robbed me of. Taking out a knife, I cut the rope and let him slide onto the floor beside the stone steps. The Father simply watched on, utterly bewildered.

“This man is deserving of your fire,” I said coldly, as the trader groaned in a deep stupor, eyes still very much closed. “I gave him some of mother’s sleeping draft. A lot, actually, while I rode him out of town and into the plains, where it was quiet and nobody…” I shuddered again, the very thought leaving me with an overwhelming urge to exhale in revolution “Would hear me…”

“Myah?” The Father was lost for words, not sure what to make of the child offering up a man for death before his eyes.

“The people of this town are good people. They don’t deserve to die. This man is not a good person. He does deserve to die.” I looked at the creature curled up on the floor, my lip curling at the very sight of him. “Set him ablaze, or let him go and kill somebody else. It’s up to you.”

I took a flask from satchel hooked onto my mare’s saddled and handed it to the Father. It was full of a clear liquid.

“That’ll be enough to keep him out until tonight,” I said, as I mounted up. “I’ll see if I can find more like him for your fires. I’ll talk to mother, she’s spent plenty of time in that town, I’m sure she’ll have a thought or two.”

“If we just take people, they’ll notice eventually.”

“It’s a rough town, a busy town. People go missing all the time… ” I shrugged, pulling my horse away and heading off and out of the quarry. “At least, that’s what we’ll tell people.“

As I rode away, the Father caught me by the leg. “You don’t have to do this, Myah.”

“We make our own path, right?” I said, kicking out and forcing his hand off my leg. I didn’t look back, I just carried on riding. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Late was the hour in the dark but restless tavern. Dim light sparked from candles hung by rusted chains cast silhouettes of the worst kind across the slowly crumbling timber-framed walls. Men in deep and drunken stupors, beards sodden and eyes glazed. Others were cloaked in the shadows of the darkest corners, figures sitting lone and sullen. Grimmest of all patrons were perhaps were the younger men, who chorused in raucous cheers and drank with bright spirits, in this, the dingiest and contemptuous of places. Yet the darkest trick of all the tavern had to offer was not the clients, but instead those that served within it.

The barman, the only man to pull a wage from the wreckage of a tavern, handed out drink without thought or acknowledgement of those who ordered. He simply swiped the money flung upon the bar and poured. He was a grizzled and unsightly creature. Sunken eyes, wide-faced, thinning hair, boils clinging to his crooked nose and an unkempt, almost wild, beard. But he wasn’t the worst sight to behold.

Three rakishly thin women, all narrow faced, hair as thin as the barman’s and draped in the cheapest of linen dresses swept between the tables, clearing drinks away whilst mopping up the drool and vomit. Not one could make a pass of the tavern without being groped, or leered at, or shot a putrid comment. Every now and then, men would wander to the barkeep and barter for time with the woman; his daughters. The barman would always oblige. Each time they would protest, but he would hear nothing of it and they’d be led away. Maybe they used to kick and scream, but not anymore. But even this, was not the worst of it.

Bankamp was not a native to the part of the world. He hadn’t been this far south in all his many years, he’d been keen to avoid it, but a job was a job. He knew people this far below the world were different, he’d met a few before. The nights were longer and darker, the snowfall was near constant and the temperature so low that only the toughest, most hardened animals or people could survive. He had resided to an acceptance of the place he was in. Yes, he detested it. Yes, he would be glad to be rid of it, but as the blizzard churned outside and the ale kept his body warm, he would make his peace with the dreary surroundings and sickest of people. It was only for a few days. Keep his head down and his mind on greener pastures. This was his plan at least. But then she appeared. The brightest of faces he’d seen in weeks. And the most horrible of things he’d seen in his long life.

She wore a long dress, once white but now stained and grey; ripped at the seams and patched up in places. Her hair was a shimmering blonde that stood out in the flickering darkness. She held an expression of anguish upon her soft and pale face, cheeks plumper than her narrow figure should have allowed. Her deep green eyes scanned the room gloomily, as the barman hauled her up on the countertop for all to see.

“Who has her tonight?” He called out, and the bidding started.

Shouts called in from about the room, the price rising higher and higher. The auction became rowdy. People laughed and cheered and swayed with their drink as the money went up, slower and slower by the moment. People this far south had little in the way of coin, but clearly what they had was worth spending on her. The bidding ceased as a man hit the limits of his kin. A vulgar old thing, he was weighed down by fat that ran circles around his body. His bald head shone with sweat as he heaved himself up and waddled across the tavern. He took his prize by the hand as she fearfully hopped to the floor. The girl was half his height, and probably four times his junior.

She couldn’t have been over eleven.  

The grizzly, rotund buyer growled hungrily as he eyed up his purchase. His heavy breathing carried across the tavern as men wandering past with sloshing tankards slapped his shoulder in celebration. He took in a deep and pleasureful sigh, salvia slapping against his jowls as he did. But before the deal could be done, as he moved to lay his coin on the table, his hand was caught.

Bankamp clutched his wrist tightly, so tightly that he winced with pain and withdrew. The old soldier seethed at the rounded figure before him, a stern stare turning to a soft gaze as his eyes fell upon the little girl. He reached into his tunic, the finest piece of clothing in the room, and pulled out his own coin, flinging it upon the bar. It was a meagre amount, but more than the man had bid for the girl and the barkeep snapped it up quickly.

“Sorry Borg, out of towners always have the coin.”

The ballooning old Borg snarled at Bankamp, but had no more to offer. He let the girl’s hand go harshly and staggered back to his drink. All eyes fell upon Bankamp, and then swiftly off him and back to their own business as he threw a stony glare about the tavern. His own attention fell upon the barman.

“Where do I take her?” Bankamp demanded.

The girl showed him the way. Around the back of the bar to a staircase and down below into the basement. The halls were dark and cold, lit by a single flaming torch precariously placed on a mental bracket hanging by one nail hammered tight, and another much looser. Carefully, she inched open one of a few wooden doors that lay off the hall, letting it swing with a creak, and beckoned for Bankamp to enter. Inside was much warmer, but no kinder on the eye. Stone walls, stone floors, wooden rafted ceilings that groaned under the weight of men walking about the tavern overhead. A fire burned in a hearth, smoke rising up a narrow chimney and out into the cold night. A small bed lay in the corner, a thin mattress upon its frame, with a solitary tatty sheet and no pillow. The girl closed the door, walked slowly to the bed and started to undress with her back turned. Bankamp caught her by the shoulder as she unbuttoned her clothes.

“Please, don’t.” He said softly.

The girl looked up at him, dress already half slung over her slender shoulder. She carefully did up her buttons and sat on the mattress at Bankamp’s gesture. He leant down to a squat before her, meeting her eye to eye.

“Who are you?” Bankamp asked, softer still. His voice calm and kind. He feared anything would frighten this fragile young girl. She was not a hardened native of the south. Her skin was too smooth. Her hair too fair.

The girl said nothing, she just looked at her feet.

“What is your name?” Bankamp tried a simpler approach.

“Miya.” The girl breathed back, so quietly he almost missed it.

“That’s a beautiful name.” Bankamp smiled. “I’ve met a few Miya’s in my time, and none so far south. You aren’t from around here, are you Miya?”

The girl looked up and shook her head. Her eyes were filled with tears.

“What happened, Miya?”

Miya’s tear-sodden eyes were pierced with a blast of fire. “They killed him.”

“Who was killed?” Bankamp placed a hand on the girl’s knee, trying to comfort her, but she shook him away. He withdrew swiftly, taking a step back.

“Who was?” He repeated.

“My Da,” Miya answered through gritted teeth. “We came to trade, he went missing one night. They found him dead in the snow. I know they killed him.”

Her eyes welled with tears again. “They wanted me.”

“They trapped you here?” Bankamp asked, trying to hold back the anger he felt burning inside him.

“I had nobody but Da, and now I have nothing but this place. I tried to run once. I came back… It’s so cold out there.”

Bankamp said nothing. He just watched the girl as she shifted uncomfortably where she sat, aware of his gaze but not sure what to do with it. He was as uncertain as her. He was warned not to upset the locals. Explicitly and without exception. But how could he not, after what these people were doing to this young girl?

“Why aren’t you doing to me what they do to me?” She asked, breaking the silence.

Bankamp recoiled, aghast by the idea.

“Because where I come from. And you come from. Men don’t do that. You can’t have been here so long as to have forgotten.”

“I think a year,” Miya replied. “But I don’t know. I do forget things about home. I try not to think much at all.”  

“How long did I pay for with you?” Bankamp asked, moving the conversation along, unsure of what to do with her words.

“Until the sun rises. You’ll know once the fire burns out and the light comes in through the chimney.” Miya pointed to the still crackling blaze along the back wall of the stone room. “Only one man per night. He doesn’t want me too badly spoilt.”

Bankamp gritted his teeth as he felt his nails dig into his palms.

“You should rest.” He said to her with a weak smile.

Miya didn’t take much persuading. She quickly found herself laying on the tough mattress, the sheet draped over her.

“Will you stay?” She asked with a note that was almost pleading. “I don’t feel safe on my own.”

“Yet you feel safe with a stranger?”

“You are the strangest man to ever visit me, but maybe that is why I feel safe.”

Bankamp gave a smile, wider this time, and nodded. He rose from his squat and sat on the end of the bed, leaning up against the wall. The curled toes of Miya lay just shy of his legs.

“Why are you here?” It was the girl’s turn to question her guest.  

“Same reason as your father. Same reason any respectable man comes down this far. Trade.”

“You should leave,” Miya warned. “It’s not safe here.”

“I was a soldier, dear girl. A good one. A strong one. That’s why my Lord hired me to come this far and be his voice. I may be older, but I still remember my youth. I can handle myself, you needn’t worry about me.”

“I wish my Da could have handled himself.” Miya sighed, mournfully.

Bankamp looked down upon the girl. She was curled up even tighter now, sheet clung to her narrow figure. Her eyes were closed, but the sadness was still easy to see on her lips and puffy cheeks.

“Miya. Would you allow me to step outside for a moment?”

She bolted upright, gripping his arm. Eyes wide and scared.

“Why? You aren’t giving me to somebody else are you?”

“I will be back,” Bankamp said soothingly, patting her on the arm and easing her back onto the mattress. “I just need to answer the call of nature.”

“I have a chamber pot beneath the bed.” Miya went to reach for it, but the older man stopped her.

‘I daren’t do that before a lady.” Bankamp said with an air of the respectable soldier left in him. Miya blushed. He didn’t suppose many she met would have such dignity, or call her a lady.

Bankamp found the barkeep in the hallway, lugging a cask towards the stairs.

“Fun isn’t she?” He grinned as Bankamp approached, lowering the heavy cask to the ground with a groan. The retired soldier wanted to bludgeon the man with his own barrel of drink there and then, but he held himself back. His patron would have him hung by the thumbs if he disobeyed his orders. The goal wasn’t just to sell or buy from those this far south, the miners and quarrymen, but continued trade. Trade for years to come. Slaying a barman was not going to be good for business.

“How much?” Bankamp demanded, dodging the question.

“For what?”

“To buy the girl. I want to take her.”

The barkeep laughed. “She isn’t for sale.”

“All things are for sale.”

“She is not. Maybe when she turns of age, but right now, the money, the business, the perks…” The barkeep cracked a wicked smile. “They are just too good for one payment. Sorry, my friend.”

The barkeep hauled the cask above his waist and began to amble up the stairs, leaving Bankamp behind, feeling hopeless and defeated. His dejected state only worsened as he entered Miya’s room. She looked up at him, almost happily, as he came back in, before laying back down.

“I was worried you’d leave.”

“I paid for this bed ‘til morning,” Bankamp said, sitting back down by her feet, kicking off his boots and making himself as comfy as possible against the hard and cold brickwork. “And I intend to get my money’s worth.”

“You can lay with me if you like,” Miya said with warmth, but her voice quickly turned cold. “Most that stay do.”

Bankamp shook his head. “You keep your space dear girl, I am fine as I am.”

 

 

Leaving in the morning was one of Bankamp’s greatest trials, and he’d faced some nasty ones over his years. Prying the girl’s tiny fingers from his wrist was made possible only by the promise that he would return that evening, with enough coin to pay for another night in her bedroom. Miya’s eyes lit brighter than the fire Bankamp had rekindled in the hearth to keep them warm through the night, and to stop the girl from stirring in the cold; the shivers of the frozen wastes that encircled her abode crept up on her as she dozed. The young one had slept a deep and long slumber, a rest Bankamp thought was likely to be the first proper one in quite some time.

The inescapable cold couldn’t help but remind Bankamp of where he was, and what he was tasked to do. Trade talks were drawn out, weary and tiresome. Bankamp often found his mind wandering to Miya, worrying over her being alone with that detestable barman. When his focus could fall upon trade, it was of ore and smelting. The mines buried deep in the icy wastes this far south offered riches untold in the warmer and more hospitable lands that the old soldier, and Miya, hailed from. The mines were manned by many of the grim and lecherous creatures Bankamp so eagerly wanted to see castrated and cast outside to shrivel in the cold; it pained him that his hands were so fiercely bound by his duties. A long and fruitful deal meant he needed those workers alive and digging.

A price was agreed, samples were shared, and the owners of the mines were to take him to view their extensive goods and workers the following day, which left Bankamp able to keep his promise. A promise he had, in all honesty, not expected to make good on. To leave Miya like that would have broken his heart, but he knew it would only get worse. He couldn’t take her where he was going, and he couldn’t stay forever.

As the light dwindled, he wondered about remaining at the inn his Lord had paid for. He thought about staying away from the tavern and letting the memory fade. But it was wasted effort, and he soon found his boots crunching over freshly fallen snow, thick furs wrapped about his wide-set frame, as he marched through the harsh and scarring winds towards the wooden doors of the seedy drinking hole.

Bankamp brought a shoulder of mutton from the barman, roasting it over the fire in the corner of Miya’s room. The scrawny girl devoured her food as if she were the monstrous Borg. There was little in the way of fat on her. Her childlike, rounded face was a stark contrast to her arms and legs, so thin Bankamp knew they’d be easier to snap than the kindling he would regularly cast upon the hearth.

“Is there no family for you back home?” Bankamp dared to ask as the conversation moved away from his explanations of the trade he had travelled for.

Miya shook her head.

“Ma died many years ago. Grandfather not long before we left. You remind me of him. He was kind.” She smiled up at him, before a grin spread across her face. “And old, too.”

Bankamp made a look of mock indignation. The spirit in Miya was a marvel to him. How she could live through the horrors she had, and for so long, and still smile a smile so bright that it warmed like no fire ever could, astounded him. He wondered how long that would last once he was gone.

“Do you have family?” Miya asked as she gnawed at the bone clutched between her spindly fingers.

It was Bankamp’s turn to shake his head.

“I was born to be a fighter. Raised to be a warrior and I did my duties until my bones were too weak to hold my shield high enough to protect my fellow men. But while I do still have my youth.” He shot Miya a peevish glare as she snorted with laughter. “I’ve seen too much…”

A harsh tone wrapped his words. He looked darkly into the fire as it flickered across his troubled eyes. “I couldn’t take a wife. Nor settle to a family. I have to keep moving. It’s the only way I can outrun the ghosts that chase me.”

“Do they follow you so far south?” Miya was looking up at him with curious wide eyes. Bankamp wasn’t sure if she was young and naive enough to believe he was talking of actual ghosts.

“They will eventually.” He replied with certainty.

The two remained quiet for a while. The silence broken only by the crackling of the fire and the occasional thud of boots on the floor above.

“Will I haunt you?” Miya’s words pierced the peaceful moment like a knife, tearing it to shreds. And, indeed, it felt as though a knife had pierced Bankamp, as his stomach lurched and twisted.

He sighed. “Worse than any of them.”

Miya sank into herself, curling her back and placing her head in her hands. Bankamp raised his hand to comfort her, but thought better of it. She needed her moment to grieve what was to be lost.

“Have you killed many men?” Came the muffled words of Miya as she talked into her hands.

“Yes.” The old soldier replied gruffly.

“Could you kill another?”

Miya met the gaze of Bankamp as he looked down her. She held a stony expression, determined and earnest. His was far more unsettled.

“What?”

“Can you kill the Dinap? The Barman. I want him to die.”

Bankamp breathed out deeply. “I want him to die as well, and I would, if I could. But my Lord does not permit me to do such things. He would see me hang for it, I’m sure. He needs this deal, and he needs this trade.”

He drew his eyes away from Miya, unable to take guilt that washed over him from the look of sadness and disappointment that fell upon her face.

“Is tonight your last night here with me?” She asked, dusting off her dress as she clambered up from the floor.

Bankamp nodded.

“Maybe I should just kill you instead” Miya said with a distinct taunting arrogance in her voice. “Steal all your money and go.”  

Bankamp laughed. “Go ahead. There’s a knife in my coat.” He flung his hand towards the door on which his thick fur jacket was hooked. “I have plenty of money on me. But money isn’t going to get a girl like you far around here, and you know it.”

“Can we sleep? I have not slept so well as I did last night since I left home. Maybe I never will again.” The brightness had gone from Miya’s words, as had sadness, fear or any emotion. She seemed cold and distant. She’d let him see a glimpse of the girl she was beneath, but Bankamp knew this was the face she must have worn most days. The face that kept her alive. Hollow, empty but still here at least. Her fun was over, her glimpse of peace and safety faded, and she knew it.

 

Bankamp jolted awake. It was the screams that woke him. The fire was still burning, but the room was empty. Miya was gone. The door was swung open. Another scream, a woman’s scream, echoed down the hall. It wasn’t Miya.

He wrenched himself up from the bed. As his hands pushed away from the sheets, Bankamp felt them slide on the coarse fabric. Looking down in horror, his eyes fell upon blood-soaked palms. They began to shake as he stared at them. He could feel his heartbeat now, crashing around his chest.

Miya appeared in the doorway.

“You were supposed to save me.” She whispered. “You were supposed to take me away.”

“What?” Bankamp gasped back. “What’s going on?”

Miya said nothing. She just reached around the door and grabbed the old soldier’s coat, before disappearing out of sight.

“Where are you going?” Bankamp shouted, quickly wiping as much blood off his hands on the sheets as he could before racing out the door after her. Emerging into the dimly lit hallway, he realised what had happened. As Miya climbed up the stairwell, below her, at the foot of the stairs, lay the barkeep. Bankamp recognised his knife, thrust into the man’s chest. Blood coated his body, and the craggy stone floor around him.

Two of his daughters leaned over him. They didn’t seem sad or distressed, the screams probably of shock more than anything else. They showed no emotion at all, that was until they noticed Bankamp. They backed away fearfully as he got closer to the barkeep. He couldn’t help but notice that their eyes fell upon his blood-soaked hands. He threw a glare up towards Miya whose ankles were visible, just for a moment, before she vanished once more.

She’d got him.

Bankamp quickly knelt beside Dinap’s body, yanked the knife from his chest, wiped it against the man’s clothes and followed Miya up into the tavern. It was empty and shut up, stools resting on tables and tankards all stacked behind the bar. No sunlight was to be seen creeping its way through the buildings cracking facade. The frozen night still gripped tightly to the world outside.  

Miya stood by the door, coat in hand. She was just waiting with a calm patience.    

“What have you done girl?” Bankamp boomed, storming across the creaking woodwork towards her, yanking his clothing from her grasp.

“I’m escaping.” She responded flatly. Her eyes were still empty. Her cold, calculating mind almost visible behind her vacant stare. “You’ve no choice but to run, and you’ll take me with you.”

“I’ll take you with me?” Bankamp fumed. “You’ve ruined me, you’ve made me a murderer! I can’t return home.”

“You have no home. No family to return to. And you won’t leave me here.”

“And why not?” Bankamp bore down on the girl, his fearsome tone and fiery eyes failed to even gain the slightest of reactions from the girl.

“Because you’re haunted,” Miya said, leaning into his glare. “And I’ll haunt you worse than anyone if you leave me here. Dinap sold me, but he also protected me from the worst of them… but there is nobody to help me now. You don’t know if I’ll live to see tomorrow morning.”

“You don’t know if you’ll live to see tomorrow morning with me either,” Bankamp growled, but once again, she’d got him.

Ripping open the door, he slung his coat around them both and powered through the snowfall, searching the darkness for the light hanging from the porch of the inn. He prayed the wax was still burning.

His jacket didn’t quite cover them both, and an icy chill swelled beneath the furs, biting at his body like a thousand frozen blades. The pain was tough for even Bankamp. For Miya, a small girl in a thin dress, it must have been nearly unbearable, but still she forged on without a hint of weakness. Bankamp pulled her closer as they searched in the darkness. At last, the candlelight, splintered through the cracked lantern glass, flickered in the distance.

He took with him all he had, which was little. A small rucksack of clothes, a saddle bag of food and supplies for the road, and the valuable ore and smelt samples Bankamp had been tasked to bring back for his Lord. Miya stood silently, hands clasped to the window ledge of the small bedroom the old soldier now wished he had remained within on his travels, waiting for the sun to rise. The moment its bright glimmer stretched its way over the ice-bound horizon, revealing dark silhouettes of far-away mountains, they were gone. By the time the sun was visible over the ranges, he and Miya were far from the reaches of the tavern.

Miya’s stoic silence was broken as she collapsed into a heap mane of the galloping steed, weeping uncontrollably. Emotion, whether it was sadness, fear or joy, overcame her. Bankamp said nothing and did nothing. He just left her to cry, wrapped in the spare furs he’d bought for nights on the road. He didn’t know where they were going. He knew he couldn’t go back to his Lord. Word would spread from the traders. He wasn’t just a troublemaker, he was a murderer, too. His Lord wouldn’t need much more to have his head, and then what would become of the girl? Orphans didn’t fare well wherever they were.

Despite his anger. Despite his anguish, he couldn’t help but respect Miya. She’d used him, and used him brilliantly. Every word he’d said, every weakness he’d revealed, she’d used without mercy. She had done what he was too much of a coward to do; what he’d wished he had done. She’d freed a helpless child from a world so brutal and vile it made his stomach churn.

Bankamp didn’t have a direction, nor an idea of where to go next, but what he did have was fine ore, good coin and something new to keep his ghosts at bay. <|endoftext|>

Shadows Over Innocence

Sicarius slipped into an expansive room in the Imperial Barracks, the rambling old 
building that held offices and residences for the emperor and those who assisted him in 
his rule. As the throne's assassin, Sicarius counted as one of those men. He set down a 
large, bloodstained sack and leaned against a pillar in the shadows.
On the far end of the rectangular space, sunlight streamed through the spotless panes 
of tall windows, warming the marble floor and the back of the room's single occupant. 
The small boy pushed a tangled thatch of pale brown hair out of his eyes and hunkered 
over a gleaming, white floor tile, a charcoal stick grasped between his fingers. Heedless 
of the sanctity of the palatial décor, he squiggled lines onto the floor with precise 
squeaks. Sicarius cocked his head, surprised at the intricacy of the pattern forming.
Footsteps echoed from the corridor. Two men, one grayer than the other but both past 
middle age, strode into the bright chamber. The child bolted upright. He clutched the 
charcoal stick behind his back and shrank into himself.
"Sespian!" Raumesys Savarsin, the younger of the two men and the twenty-seventh 
emperor of Turgonia, curled his fingers into a fist and glared at the boy. "What are you 
doing?"
Eyes downcast, Sespian whispered, "Drawing, Father."
Unnoticed by anyone, Sicarius clenched his jaw as he watched from the shadows.
"Drawing." Raumesys turned to the willowy, gray-haired man next to him, 
Commander of the Armies Hollowcrest. "My son, the future emperor and leader of our 
armies, is drawing on the floor of the solarium." He turned back to the boy. "Come here!"
For a moment, Sespian hesitated, eyes darting, as if he might flee into the shadows, 
but Raumesys growled, and the boy plodded forward. Chin drooped to his chest, he 
halted before the men. The emperor bent and grabbed his arm, knuckles whitening. The 
boy flinched, but he did not cry out when the charcoal stick was ripped from his grasp. 
Raumesys snapped it in half, the crack echoing through the silent room like a bone 
breaking.
"Father!" Anguish flashed across the boy's face as the splintered halves clacked to the 
floor and rolled across the marble. "That was my only—"
"And you'll get no more." The emperor dropped to one knee and grabbed Sespian by 
the front of his shirt. "You're five years old now. It's time you stopped playing and started 
learning how to lead a nation. No more foolish scribbling on the floor, do you 
understand?"
"Mother always lets me..."
"Your mother's too soft with you. You will rule a nation of warriors one day. You 
must be strong."
Knowing the shadows hid him, Sicarius let his fingers curl into fists. Not for the first 
time, he was tempted to intervene, to protect the boy from such abuse, but he did not 
move. Speaking against the emperor—thinking against the emperor—was not permitted. 
He had learned that lesson well as a boy.
"No more drawing," Raumesys repeated. He pulled Sespian close, twisting his arm. 
"Do you understand?"
The boy winced. "Yes, Father."
Cold and distant, Commander of the Armies Hollowcrest watched impassively. A 
familiar sight, Sicarius thought, as he remembered Hollowcrest's presence during his 
childhood training sessions. Steal sixteen years, and this moment might have been with 
him. No, he reminded himself; this cruelty was mild compared to what he'd endured. 
Sespian was Raumesys's heir, not some future assassin they were training. The boy would 
learn resilience and survive. Despite the thoughts, it took some effort to force his fists to 
unclench.
"Such frivolity should be punished, Sire," Hollowcrest said.
To deter that punishment, Sicarius picked up the sack and strode into the center of the 
chamber. The emperor, reminded of work matters, ought to send the boy away.
Sespian's eyes bulged at Sicarius's approach. He tried to squirm away from his 
father's grip.
Sicarius knew that, dressed all in black accented with throwing knives and daggers, 
he wasn't the friendliest looking man. He wished he could soften his face for the boy's 
sake, but that wasn't permitted either. As they'd long ago drilled into his head, the face 
must be kept devoid of thought and emotion, lest an enemy gather information from one's 
eyes. He'd been punished relentlessly until he'd mastered a façade that they deemed 
acceptable.
Raumesys noticed Sicarius's approach first and twitched in surprise before recovering 
a more regal bearing.
Hollowcrest did not twitch. He said, "Sicarius," by way of greeting and eyed the sack. 
"Were you successful? Did you get them all?"
"Yes," Sicarius said.
"Let's see," Raumesys said.
Sicarius glanced at Sespian.
Hollowcrest raised an eyebrow. Though thin, wire-framed spectacles perched upon 
his hawkish nose, his dark brown eyes remained sharp, and he missed little. "Concerned 
for the boy?"
Sicarius knew the words were a test. Everything was always a test. "No," he said, 
giving the expected response. "Concern is a feeling, and feelings interfere with duty."
Hollowcrest nodded his approval.
"Sespian will stay," Raumesys said. "Time he learns what comes with the position."
Anger simmered behind Sicarius's carefully constructed mask. The boy was too 
young; he shouldn't have to witness such atrocities. "Understood, Sire," was all he said.
Hollowcrest twitched his fingers in a get-on-with-it motion.
Sicarius untied the bag and upended it. Four severed heads rolled out and bounced on 
the white marble. Though desiccated and distorted after weeks of travel, they were still 
identifiable: man, woman, and children.
Sespian screamed and jerked away from his father. He stumbled, recovered, and fled 
the room. Sicarius was the only one to watch him go.
Raumesys slapped a palm on his thigh. "Excellent."
"Yes," Hollowcrest said. "There'll be no more talk of uniting the tribes in Mangdoria, 
with their most prominent chief dead, along with any hope of worthy scions." He nodded 
to Sicarius. "Go relax. We'll have something new for you in a day or two."
"Yes, sir."
Sicarius padded toward the exit, his soft black boots silent on the tile floor. He paused 
in the doorway and glanced at the backs of the two older men.
The emperor emitted a nervous chuckle. "You trained him too well, Hollow. The man 
bothers me."
"He is loyal."
"I know. You did a good job. I ought to give you Sespian to work with. The boy is 
disappointing."
"He does seem soft," Hollowcrest said.
"Did you hear that scream? I would've been fascinated by severed heads at that age."
"You're fascinated with them now, Sire."
"True enough."
They shared a laugh and headed for the door. Sicarius slipped away before they 
noticed him.
* * *
Darkness pressed against the windows overlooking the large gymnasium in the rear of 
the Imperial Barracks. Sicarius grabbed a towel and wiped sweat from his face and bare 
torso. He'd warmed up with a couple of hours running sprints, scaling the climbing wall, 
and strengthening his muscles with sand-filled bags of various weights. Then he'd talked 
quasi-worthy, off-duty soldiers into wrestling and boxing with him. More precisely, he'd 
stared at them and pointed to the rings painted on the wooden floor until they'd joined 
him. Some of them knew who he was, and others did not, but nobody had disobeyed.
The bouts had been short and not particularly satisfying. For years, Hollowcrest had 
brought in tutors from all over the world to instruct Sicarius on different combat styles, 
and, even though the best soldiers in the army were chosen to work at the Barracks, it'd 
been some time since any had challenged him. Honing a blade on a dull stone was 
difficult, but better than letting it rust. Hollowcrest, Sicarius reminded himself, would 
send him to the Global Grappling Tournament in the summer, an event where the best 
warriors in the world competed for honor and, more important for Sicarius, could learn 
from those better than themselves.
"Men, attention!" someone called from a ring near the doorway.
Everyone stopped in place and stood straight, heels smacking together as Commander 
of the Armies Hollowcrest strode into the gymnasium.
"At ease," he said.
As soon as Hollowcrest wasn't looking in their direction, the soldiers snatched their 
gear and disappeared. Sicarius, doubting the Commander of the Armies had come to 
throw sandbags around, folded his towel, set it on a bench beside his shirt, which was 
also folded, and clasped his hands behind his back to wait.
Hollowcrest stopped before Sicarius. "I told you to relax."
"Yes, sir."
A tight smile of approval creased Hollowcrest's face. They both knew this was what 
he'd meant by the order. He would not have been pleased if he'd found Sicarius anywhere 
else.
"There's a new adjudicator in the northeastern city-state," Hollowcrest said. "He's 
trying to start a desert-wide trade embargo against us. The emperor wants him eliminated. 
You'll leave in the morning."
"Yes, sir." Sicarius picked up his shirt. "And this evening?"
"Do a round of the Barracks. Colonel Bratnuvic took over security last month. His 
work seems adequate." Hollowcrest lifted a shoulder. "But I suspect your experience has 
given you expertise in such matters. Let me know if you find any weaknesses."
"Yes, sir."
Sicarius ghosted through the corridors of the Barracks, questioning guards and noting 
the state of each entrance. He entered the extensive dungeons, and memories of 
childhood training sessions flitted through his mind as he passed walls full of torture 
implements. Prisoners strung from shackles cringed when they noticed him, but he did 
nothing more than register their presence as he checked hidden exits, ensuring they were 
not accessible from the outside.
Before going outdoors to continue his inspection, Sicarius stopped in the kitchen. 
Spoons scraped and pans clattered as two-dozen men and women prepared the evening 
meal. A few noticed him as he entered, and they quickly looked away. Scents of 
complex, spiced dishes brushed his nose, but he chose unseasoned fish and roasted 
vegetables, then retreated to a remote table. He put his back to the corner and watched the 
busy area while he ate.
Halfway through his meal, a familiar figure scampered into the kitchen. The boy 
darted behind the apron of a heavyset woman and peered back the way he had come.
"Prince Sespian." The woman put down a spoon and planted her hands on her hips. 
"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with your tutor?"
The boy offered her a shy smile. "I'm hiding from him."
"But why?"
He looked up at her with imploring brown eyes. "He's boring. I don't care about 
armies and history and war and all that stuff."
The woman's eyebrows drew down, but the corners of her mouth twitched.
"Can I stay here?" Sespian asked. "Please?"
She picked him up and plopped him onto a nearby table. "Do you want old Dana to 
get in trouble for hiding a fugitive?"
The boy's gentle eyes widened, and he shook his head.
She clucked her tongue. "You can sit there while we work, but when your tutor finds 
you in here, no more running, yes?"
After a pause, Sespian nodded. As soon as the cook turned her back, he plucked two 
spoons out of a ceramic utensil holder, flipped them around, and began tapping out a 
rhythm on the tabletop. The boy had dexterous fingers. He'd do well at blade lessons 
when he grew older. Or perhaps not. His list of "boring" suggested he had little interest in 
martial matters. Sicarius sometimes wondered what he might have found interesting as a 
boy, if he'd been allowed the freedom to choose his areas of study.
"Where'd you learn that?" Dana asked him, gesturing toward the tapping spoons.
Sespian shrugged. "Just did."
"Ah? You should have a tutor who can give you some music lessons."
A smile started to form on the boy's lips, but it quickly faded. "Father wouldn't let me. 
Father says things like that are worthless." He set down the spoons and dropped his gaze. 
"He took away my pens and paper. He says I can't draw any more."
"Well, you must do as he says."
"He hates me," Sespian whispered too softly for Sicarius to hear, but he read the 
words on the boy's lips.
The cook frowned and patted him on the shoulder. A reedy gray-haired man came in, 
eyes narrowing as he focused on Sespian. He stalked across the room and grabbed his 
wayward student by the arm.
"You've wasted our time tonight, Prince Sespian." He pulled the boy off the table. 
"Now it's bedtime, and you've learned nothing. Surely, the citizens of Turgonia would 
tremble if they knew a boy such as you was being raised to lead them."
Without thinking, Sicarius left his meal and set a path to intersect boy and tutor. He 
stopped in front of them, blocking their route. The tutor's mouth dropped, and he fell 
back a step. Sicarius stared at him, but realized he had nothing to say. The boy had 
nothing to do with his duty—what was he doing?
Sespian's head lolled back, and his eyes widened. When Sicarius looked down at him, 
the boy pulled his arm out of his tutor's grasp. He stumbled back a few steps, then turned 
and sprinted toward the nearest exit.
"Pardon me," the tutor mumbled and darted after Sespian.
Sicarius sighed softly. Meal forgotten, he resumed his inspection. He left the kitchen, 
then the Barracks. Dusk had fallen. He ignored the caress of crisp air on his cheeks, 
noting instead tactical strengths and weaknesses in the structures and walls. By habit, he 
studied each guard, servant, and hired hand he passed, marking walk, build, and weapons 
carried.
A corporal and a private were stationed at the front gate. When he approached, the 
corporal straightened and clicked his heels together. The private, a younger man, eyed 
Sicarius's plain black clothes with furrowed brow. Sicarius wasn't in the Barracks much, 
so there were many people who didn't recognize him, but something about this private 
made him pause. Like his comrade, he wore a gold-piped blue uniform, but unlike his 
comrade, he had Turgonia's insignia, crossed swords over a craggy mountain, pinned to 
his right breast instead of his left. Sicarius stared him in the eye. The private cleared his 
throat and glanced at his superior.
"Help you, sir?" the corporal asked.
Sicarius kept his gaze on the younger man. "For a soldier, there is supposed to be no 
greater honor than serving on the emperor's estate."
"Yes, sir," the private whispered, eyes darting.
"Such an honor that you didn't bother to dress correctly?"
"I..." The private looked down, studying his uniform. After a furtive glance at the 
corporal, realization came, and he touched his chest. "Yes, sir. I mean no, sir. It was an 
accident."
Sicarius listened, placing the man's accent as northeastern Turgonia, the area closest 
to Mangdorian borders. That in itself was not suspect—soldiers were moved around the 
empire often during the course of their careers—but coupled with the misplaced 
insignia…
"New man, corporal?" Sicarius asked.
"Yes, sir. Came up from the garrison just today."
The private shifted his weight.
"Anyone come through the gates while you've been on shift?" Sicarius asked.
"Some folks left," the corporal said, "but none have come in since I got on. Except... I 
got sick for a bit and the private was alone."
"Sick?"
"Had to run to the latrine. Something I ate…" The corporal squinted at his younger 
comrade. "He brought pastries at the start of—"
The private shoved the corporal into Sicarius and bolted. He fled out the gate, skidded 
on the flagstones, and disappeared around the corner. Sicarius pushed the soldier aside 
and raced after the man. His prey sprinted down the street, running in and out of the 
influence of gas lanterns burning on the Imperial Barracks' outer wall, and toward the 
trolley tracks and roadways of the city. He must have hoped to evade pursuit amongst the 
buildings and dark alleys. On the parapet above, guards patrolled—guards with access to 
muskets and cannons—but no one fired at the fleeing man. Of course not. He wore an 
army uniform. Sicarius might have yelled up and explained the situation, but it'd be more 
efficient to simply handle the spy himself.
He increased his speed, arms pumping as hard as his legs. The spy's boots thudded on 
roads slick with frost, and crystallized puffs of air drifted behind as he ran, his ragged 
breaths audible in the still evening. As he'd been so trained, Sicarius made not a sound. 
He closed the distance. Ten meters. Five.
The man sprinted through a square at the base of the hill and glanced back, perhaps 
believing he'd outrun his pursuer. His eyes bulged when he spotted Sicarius just behind. 
The spy's jaw firmed, and he whipped his sword from its sheath, turning around as he did 
so, holding it out, perhaps hoping Sicarius might impale himself.
Sicarius shifted his weight and, between one step and the next, halted out of blade 
reach. A few passersby paused, heads cocked.
"Criminal!" the soldier shouted, pointing at Sicarius with his sword.
At the private's proclamation, citizens opened their doors and came outside. 
Pedestrians murmured to each other. More than one person touched a sword or dagger. 
Without rank or uniform, Sicarius did not bother arguing. He kept the encroaching 
citizens in mind, but focused on his opponent.
Falling into a ready crouch, the spy brandished his blade. A smug smile creased his 
face. Sicarius had no sword with him, and he had not drawn a knife.
Certainly believing his opponent helpless, the spy lifted an arm to strike. Sicarius 
stepped aside, dodging the blow easily, then lunged in behind the attack. He grasped the 
man's wrist and twisted it against the joint, catching the sword when it dropped. The man 
squawked in pain and tried to pull away. Sicarius snaked his leg behind his opponent's 
knee, sweeping him off balance. Only the arm Sicarius wrapped around the man's neck 
kept him from pitching to the street. The spy clawed at the grip, but Sicarius merely 
squeezed harder. Soon his opponent's breaths came in wheezes.
The approaching citizens hesitated. Without releasing his man, Sicarius lifted the 
soldier's blade and eyed them with a cool stare. Their hands dropped from their weapons, 
and they backed away.
"Who did you let through the gate?" Sicarius asked his prisoner.
The soldier squirmed, but did not answer. Sicarius dropped the sword and gouged his 
thumb into the depression at the back of the man's jaw. He dug at the point until the man 
whimpered.
"Mangdorians... hired assassin... emperor."
Bone cracked as Sicarius broke the man's neck. He dropped the body and raced back 
to the Imperial Barracks. He'd made a mistake. Someone had seen him on his mission; 
that was the only explanation. The Mangdorians were reputed to prefer peace and 
negotiation to conflict and war, but Sicarius had encountered more than one warrior from 
that nation; not everyone believed in their god's tenets. If someone had hired an assassin, 
and if the man were successful... it would be Sicarius's fault.
The corporal at the gate had gathered more soldiers. His eyebrows rose at Sicarius's 
approach.
"There's an assassin inside," Sicarius said. "Sweep the grounds. Tell Hollowcrest."
Before the corporal could respond, Sicarius sped across the courtyard toward the 
entrance to the Barracks. He took the steps three at a time, tore open the massive doors, 
and ran down the gleaming marble corridors. On the third floor, he reached the emperor's 
suite. Two armored men wearing the black uniforms of the emperor's personal bodyguard 
stood to either side of the door.
"Sir, you can't—"
"The emperor's not to be—"
Sicarius ignored them and pushed through the door. Raumesys was sprawled naked 
on his divan with three equally naked young women draped over him. His head jerked 
up, face twisting with rage. When he identified Sicarius, his features grew more hesitant, 
but his eyes remained cold.
Schooled features neutral, Sicarius eyed the women with professional detachment. All 
three were familiar, which did not discount them, but made them unlikely assassins. He 
ignored the emperor's sputtering protests and stalked through the suite, searching the 
shadows. He found nothing.
Hollowcrest burst through the door. Six armed and armored men clanked in after him.
"Yes," Raumesys said, throwing a bare arm toward the ceiling. "Everyone come in. 
I'm obviously not busy!"
"There's an assassin on the premises," Hollowcrest said.
Instead of grabbing a weapon—or clothing—Raumesys tugged one of the girls over 
his chest. The guards placed themselves at strategic points around the room.
Satisfied that the emperor had enough men—and women—protecting him, Sicarius 
slipped into the hallway. He considered the layout of the Barracks, selecting likely hiding 
places and identifying other possible targets. Raumesys's wife? Or—a sickening thought 
flashed through Sicarius's mind, and his stomach lurched.
He took off again, candles blurring past. He turned a corner and stopped before an 
unguarded door—a door that should have been guarded. A dark smudge stained the floor. 
He bent and touched it. Fresh blood.
Sicarius eased the door open, afraid of what he would find inside. He pushed the 
thoughts aside and reached for his usual calm detachment. He had seen death in all its 
cruelties, delivered it in more cases than he could remember. Living or dead, one boy 
should not bother him.
Inside, shadows lurked. Sicarius moved away from the door, so that he wouldn't be 
silhouetted against the light of the hall.
A low-burning lantern glowed on a table beside a canopied bed that dwarfed the five 
year old curled in the sheets. Against his instincts, Sicarius let his eyes rest on the boy for 
a moment. He caught the rise and fall of rhythmic breathing, and an iota of relief trickled 
through his mind.
A faint rustle sounded. Sicarius crouched, muscles tense. He had not moved, and 
neither had the boy. Anyone who had watched him come in would know precisely where 
he was.
Willing calm into his mind and relaxation into his muscles, he scanned the room. 
Curtains and furniture cast thick, irregular shadows. As his eyes drifted away from one 
corner, movement drew them back. Reflexively, he dropped into a roll.
Something whisked over his head, pinging off the wall.
Sicarius came up running, his soft boots soundless on the thick carpet as he cut 
toward the source. The intruder stepped out to meet him. With a soft rasp, a small blade 
appeared, light from the hall revealing a gooey dark substance on the edge.
As Sicarius closed, the dagger slashed toward him. He melted away from the strike, 
then darted in, catching the man's forearm. He glided in closer, turned his hip, and hurled 
the would-be assassin over his shoulder. The man proved agile, though, and wriggled out 
of the throw before he hit the ground. Like a cat, he landed on his feet. But for a split 
second, he was off balance, and Sicarius struck. Lightning-quick, he slammed a punch 
into his foe's kidney. The force of the blow sent the man stumbling forward. Sicarius 
leaped after him, but, before he reached his target, the assassin whirled, slashing with the 
dagger. It was a desperate attack from a wounded opponent, but that didn't make the 
poison on the blade any less dangerous. Forcing himself to defend with careful, mindful 
precision, Sicarius knocked the arm wide and stepped close, launching a punch. The man 
blocked it, but the attack had been meant as a distraction, and Sicarius slammed his heel 
into his foe's knee at the same time.
The intruder went down, but he took another wild swipe with the dagger. Sicarius 
leaped backward and would have evaded the attack easily, but he'd forgotten his 
surroundings; he came up short, bumping into the bed's footboard.
Sicarius chastised himself—men died from such mistakes—even as he anticipated the 
coming attack and twisted to the side. The poisoned blade cut through his shirt, missing 
flesh by a hair. Momentum carried the dagger into the footboard, the tip sinking into the 
wood. The assassin wasted a split second trying to free it. Recognizing the advantage, 
Sicarius pounced. He spun his foe around, pinning him against the footboard, and found 
his neck. Perhaps trained as Sicarius had been, the man died in silence.
On the bed, Sespian mumbled something and stirred. Sicarius let out a slow breath 
and lifted his head. The boy did not open his eyes.
After a moment, Sicarius rose. He sheathed the man's dagger, found and pocketed a 
miniature crossbow, and slung the body over his shoulder. He trod across the carpet 
toward the door and stopped to pick up the tiny quarrel that had started the confrontation. 
The tip glistened with freshly applied poison. He left the room, shifting the weight of the 
body so that he could softly close the door.
"Sicarius!" came Hollowcrest's surprised voice as he rounded the corner. "I came to 
check on the heir..." He noticed the corpse. "I realized the boy might be a target."
"Astute," Sicarius murmured. "Sir."
Hollowcrest gave him a sharp look, then nodded toward the body. "Get rid of that."
"Yes, sir."
* * *
Sicarius found the bodies of Sespian's missing guards stuffed in a nearby room with 
the assassin's gear. The man had traveled light: a change of clothes, trail rations, 
sharpening stone, and a flat wooden box.
Before opening the box, Sicarius brushed sensitive fingers along the surface. He 
found a slight depression disguised as part of the grain. Pressing it produced a soft click. 
With wary hands, he opened the box. The tiny dart poised underneath the lid did not 
shoot out. Mindful of the tip, he removed it and fingered the contents.
Tucked inside lay a book, a pen, a charcoal stick, two brushes, and three tiny jars of 
paint. When he flipped through the book, he discovered the reason for the other items. 
The first few pages were filled with notes and detailed maps of the Imperial Barracks, the 
capital, and the nearby army fort. Perhaps the assassin intended to be paid twice, once by 
the vengeful Mangdorians and once by someone who craved information on imperial 
defenses.
Suspecting Hollowcrest would want to know about the work, Sicarius tore out the 
pages to give to him. Then he considered the box for a moment.
He tucked it under his arm and strode into the hall. For the second time that night, he 
stopped before Sespian's door. The guard had not yet been replaced. Sicarius noted the 
inefficiency and slipped into the room.
Little had changed; the boy lay on his side, fingers curled on the pillow, pale locks 
caressing his cheek. Sicarius wondered what it would be like to work for Sespian when 
he became emperor. Would he retain any of his innocence or would Raumesys and 
Hollowcrest steal it from him?
For Sicarius, duty was all he knew, all he had ever known, and he would not shirk it, 
but perhaps it was possible to shape the future of it? Or did his reasons for returning have 
nothing to do with duty at all?
He pushed aside the confusing thoughts and set the box on the bedside table. His lip 
twitched as an image flickered through his mind, and he hoped Sespian would be wise 
enough not to apply the paints to the solarium floor, at least not when Raumesys was 
around.
Sicarius returned to the hall and took up position by the door until the new guard 
came.

 <|startoftext|> Solace of the Keeper
by Woody Dismukes
If you watch the wind for long enough, you may find yourself a wisp. And though we call ourselves the Keepers, not even we can keep what is not there.

We tell the living that we keep the dead, but only because that is what they want to tell themselves. Some of us believe it too, perhaps even many. Yet the most disciplined of us know this is not the case. It is the living that are kept from the dead.

I first arrived at the monastery under these same delusions, and in no hurry to upturn my faiths. I came to find solace, though not from what you think, for there are far worse punishments than exile among the dead. I took solace from my peers — I never liked them much — and solace from my future. I was destined to be damned, either as an urchin of the streets or an urchin of the graves. And so, by my life of petty crime, it was chosen for me that I should perish as the latter.


I was not angry when my sentence was imposed, at least not at the sentence. I was angry at life itself: that which had conjured us into being without leave or explanation. We are told that life is a gift, but I never saw it as such. I saw life as a curse, and I wanted it to burn.

There was little to do about the desert plateaus. If one could not find some joy in hunting or the menial games played around the dinner table after supper, there were few other options than to read. That or drinking oneself into a state where you could forget the place you were.

My favorite place to read was among the graves. The cliffside catacombs were more intriguing and offered shelter from the wind and sand, but they offered little torchlight during the night. When the moon was large and bold enough I could read by moonlight alone, and even when it wasn’t, I could still set a lantern atop the stones and sit peacefully outside the fervor of the drunken home.

It began there, in silence, on a night when the air had grown thin with nowhere for the warmth to hide save the towering Kákkaro cactuses and the shrubs of brackenbush blossom. I didn’t mind the cold so much, as I had wrapped myself in a blanket of thick hide and preferred the chill of night over the searing sun of day.

I had already been sitting with my back against an unassuming stone, on which the name and dates had been whisked away by the desert sand to the point where the engravings were nearly indistinguishable. Had the Matron or any of the Elder Keepers been around this would have been taken as a considerable grievance but, seeing as many Keepers before me had let the stone be carved away by the wind for years, I assumed that if I should be found out my disciplining wouldn’t be very severe.

The hours of the night had already lifted the moon almost to its precipice and my lantern was beginning to dull. Although I had nearly finished my reading of Mariana de Valéctro’s A Case Study in the Behaviors of the Southern Sand Wolf, I could see that I didn’t quite have enough fuel left in my lantern to both finish the book and make my way back to the monastery dorms. Still, I was not ready to return yet, so at the end of the penultimate chapter I marked my page and dulled the fire to let the light of the stars take its place. I knew little of constellations or any sort of astronomy, but even so, I found there were fewer scenes more splendid than the shattered radiance of distant suns splattered across the uneven dark.

The beetlebugs and crickets screeched proudly to each other as a passive breeze lapped at the edges of my skin. I watched the sky slip slowly toward the pitch-black horizon where I could just barely make out the cactus silhouettes grasping their thick fingers at the air. Before this moment, my time at the monastery had felt utterly unremarkable. I neither dreaded nor anticipated the days any more than I had in the city. Life here was still just a life, though of a different sort than I had before, but in that moment I realized that for the first time I felt more than just complacent; I felt serene.

That is when I saw it. At first, I thought it was perhaps a passing cloud or maybe, as the haze coalesced, a comet bursting through the atmosphere. Yet, neither of these or anything else felt quite right. I did not have the vocabulary to describe the way the air moved or how the seeing of it made me feel.

I narrowed my eyes and sat up further, but as soon as I did the vision had passed. The night was just as it had been before. The wisp had vanished, and nothing had changed.

For most, the work we did was dull, boring work, but I didn’t mind it. It was neither hard nor easy, rote nor varied. It was suitable enough to keep one’s mind present, but not so exhausting that it drained the life from one’s body either. I was no stranger to work before my sentencing, though this work was as honest a living as I had ever made and, unlike my years in the city, life as a Keeper gave me three meals a day and a safe place to rest my head, luxuries I wouldn’t have dared imagine before.

The Matron of the House was who doled out our tasks. She was a shrewd woman, though she could hardly be called old for an Elder. She had been elected by the Committee as Elder Supreme at an unusually young age as she was well esteemed for her keen intellect and commanding presence. Many Keepers feared her. The Matron’s tongue was sharp and her judgment harsh, but I was mostly in awe of her. Never before had I met someone who appeared to have such certainty about the nature of our existence.

My favorite assignments were those within the catacombs. I was awed by the cliffside architecture and often caught myself in wonder at how the first Keepers had managed to carve such a monumental system of intricate passages whose ends surely had no bounds. If you were to climb through the plateau’s halls to the highest lookout, you could see the entire expanse of the miles of headstones planted at the plateau’s foot and even beyond. On a day when the winds were calm and the sand had all but settled, you could even see the tips of the city steeples out across the desert plains.

What lay within the cliffs was even more majestic than what lay without. The outer wall of the cliffside showed a rough history of sediment piled atop layers of millennia and scarred by innumerable catastrophes of sandstorms and prehistoric ocean tides. The tunnels, however, though they bore the same evidence of planetary evolution, were polished smooth as marble. The entire structure was a memorial of sorts. While the tombstones that lined the graves of paupers and peasants down below were crudely segregated based on whatever arbitrary distinction each separate family made of them, the ossuaries and sepulchers hidden from the daylight blended so seamlessly one could not pay homage to any individual without displaying reverence for the majesty of Death itself.

This is what I enjoyed most about it. Our work within the catacombs never felt invasive or preferential to any one grave due to wealth or former social status. The care we took of the place had nothing to do with any particular individual at all. We cared for the tombs because — unlike those from the city who rarely made the trip out into the desert to mourn or pay respects to loved ones long past — more than anything else, we respected the supremacy of mortality. Living in the city I never had respect for anything, least of all my own life, but out within the desert plateaus, one could not escape the power the dead held over us all.

Once, when I was assigned to clear the lesser-known halls of their cobwebs and pests, I was paired with a fellow Keeper who made his lack of veneration no secret. It was a dangerous job, we all knew, but it also proved as one of the more engaging. We weren’t allowed guns, lest we miss and damage a visage. Our only defences against the creatures of the dark were our bows and arrows, aside from the long staffs we carried to knock away the webs.

There were innumerous types of pests that took the darkest crypts for their dwellings, but the ones that worried us most were web-weaving solifugae that we called the Widow Weepers. Neither scorpion nor truly spider, they were large arachnids with rigid exoskeletons and poisonous hairs. They bit hard and deep, and few survived a close encounter.

However, Weepers tended to stray from the light and so it was rare we would actually see one, even when their web appeared freshly woven. Though because of this, it was easy to let one’s guard down and forget the danger one was stepping into.

Perhaps I should never have let my fellow Keeper venture into the crypt alone. Had I been with him, maybe at least one of us would have been more vigilant. Of course, these questions ultimately hold no purpose. I have long since learned hindsight to be as poisonous as a Weeper’s venom.

When I heard his cry, I leapt from my own post and ran down the darkened hall toward the sound.

“Weeper! Weeper!” His shrill shrieks echoed from chamber to chamber.

I pulled my bow from around my torso and knocked an arrow from my quiver. I tried to be quick, but not careless. If I were bitten too, there would be no help for either of us.

As I approached him his cries became more indistinct as his throat began to close. I scanned his shivering body but saw no Weeper nearby. “Brother Keeper, where did it bite you?” I asked as I dropped to my knees.

His teeth were chattering too intensely for him to speak, but he pointed at his right forearm. I could see no bite marks or swelling but also knew I wouldn’t be safe until I knew the Weeper to be dead.

I readied my bow once more and looked about the crypt. It was bright enough for me to get a fair look of the place but not enough to be certain a Weeper would remain in the shadows.

I spun around back towards the entrance, but nothing was there. Slowly, I began to scan the circuitous room floor to ceiling, my ears peeled for any disturbance behind me. I couldn’t then say exactly why, but something made my gaze stop at a kind of altar against the wall with several skulls lining the top. I lingered there for several seemingly eternal seconds before I saw the first of the Weeper’s eight long legs arc over the tops of the skulls.

The Weeper was paler than most, but as large as I’d seen. Its long wolfish hair covered its entire body as deadly strands wafted into the air when it shook. Its eyes stayed locked on me as it scraped its fat belly over the altar and dropped to the floor with a crack that sounded like splintering bones.

Keeping my breath steady, I tightened the string in my grip, easing it back to my ear. Its eyes may have been on me, but my eyes never left it either. Its crawl was slow, though I knew it could break into a sprint at any moment, and I was determined not to give it the chance.

I released the arrow and my aim was true, but the thing did not go down. Without thinking, I knocked another arrow and shot again. Once more, I managed a direct hit, and yet the Weeper appeared not even to feel the wood pierce through its body.

I began to knock a third arrow when I noticed the first two laid limply on the ground behind it. The Weeper continued to crawl forward slowly and as it did, I saw the creature was not whole. Its paleness did not come from the shade of its skin but rather its translucence. The arrows had gone right through the Weeper, just as my gaze looked directly through as well.

Raising itself on its hind four legs, the creature revealed its true size. I knew that death stood before me and I accepted it. Yet, as I did, a swift breeze filled the room and the Weeper dissipated into smoke.

It took me some time before I could regain my composure. By the time I did, my fellow Keeper was dead, foam still bubbling at his lips.

I looked around me for something to make sense of what had just happened. This crypt was not a place where I had been before, nor did it resemble any other mausoleum within the catacombs. At one end I stood dumbfounded, with my dead compatriot still and getting colder at my feet, yet I had not realized until then that another doorway stood at the other end.

I glanced down once more at my Brother Keeper. His eyes had gone yellow, the veins within now bulging blue, starved of air. Iris and pupil had melded into a cavern, devoid of light entirely. His flesh was now whiter than that of the spectral Weeper, though I could see no further through it than I could if he were carved from marble.

The time had long passed when I could do anything for him, and so I turned away and approached the opposite doorway. At first, I thought the door made of wood darker than the core of Sagjué trees of the north, but as I got closer, I realized there was no door at all, only a deep, black pit. The entryway — or exit; how was I to know? — was framed in thick blocks of quartz and at the height of the arc rested a blue crystal keystone that glowed dully.

Nothing beyond could be determined; the doorway was a hungry abyss that swallowed all that entered. On the ground, I picked up a pebble and tossed it in, stumbling back cautiously as it left my hand. Yet the rock disappeared as soon as it fell into the darkness. I heard not even a sound.

With this, a recklessness took over that I had not succumbed to since my sentencing. Deliberately, but with little care, I stepped slowly toward the black with my arm outstretched. I let only my forearm go through, nothing else. When I did, I felt nothing. No different than before. Still, my arm could no longer be seen. It was as if it too, did not exist.

I pulled my arm back and knew.

This room was no tomb; it was a gateway into something else entirely.

To be honest, I did not mourn for my fellow Keeper. Despite the urgency his final moments instilled in me, I found the body reacts quite differently when allowed time to let the blood flow through the mind. I was hardly close to him, as I rarely spent time outside of work hours with him, though I doubt I would have reacted much differently if I had known him better.

Maybe the nature of our jobs as Keepers had desensitized me to the occurrence of death. It was not the first time I had seen someone die, nor the most vicious, but something had felt different ever since I had arrived at the monastery. Death had a different air here, less immediate, more reverent. Though in this instance, I seemed to be the minority in my cold distancing.

My fellow Keeper was well liked among our peers and amongst the Elders and so the monastery was noticeably quieter following his passing. My mind however, was elsewhere, filled with images of the black doorway.

Someone had been lying to us. The Elders surely knew of what hid within the catacombs. If even a few of the tales were to be believed, then the secret gate would be the least of the demons hiding within the tunnels’ farthest reaches. And yet, knowing this only puzzled me further.

I spent much time in the monastery library attempting to gather whatever information I could on the first Keepers. From what I found, it has never been entirely clear when the first excavations of the plateaus began, whether the first Keepers expanded upon a structure of preexisting natural caverns or if they created the tombs by their hands alone. Though Vítor Sálaabôr’s A Contemporary Chronicle of the Keepers’ Histories touches briefly on what little is known of the founders of our order, whomever else I asked said that the texts of the first Keepers withered away and were lost years ago.

Because of this, I had not told anyone of the nature of the Widow Weeper after I had carried my fellow Keeper back to the monastery. I felt I would not have been believed by my peers and the time was not yet ripe for the Elders to hear of what I now knew.

For several weeks after the incident I let my thoughts lie low and within my own head. I had been reassigned to the lesser graveyards, so as to give me time to cope. But it was not time that I needed, and soon I grew restless. When my thoughts had gotten the best of me, I felt it was time to speak what I knew, and so late one night I found the Matron of the House sitting in her office.

The door was half open, though I knocked to announce myself anyway. To enter without permission would not have been the best start to our discussions. The Matron was scribbling something down on a long piece of parchment and did not pick her head up to acknowledge me. Instead, she simply said in her crisp, baritone voice, “Come, take your seat.”

I did as she said and took a seat in one of the two hard mahogany chairs in front of her desk.

“What brings you to see me, then?” she asked once I had settled.

I cleared my throat and nervously crossed my legs. “I’ve come to discuss with you the recent death of our Brother Keeper.” The Matron grunted as if she already knew this was not the whole truth. Still, she did not look up from her scribbling. For a few moments I waited for her response but, upon realizing she had no intentions of doing so, I continued. “Forgive me, Matron, but I have not been entirely forthcoming about our Brother Keeper’s death.”

The Matron raised an eyebrow. “Is that so?” she asked. “What further did you have to offer on the subject?”

My palms suddenly felt hot and wet, so I wiped them on my robes as I spoke. “As the medical examiner herself has confirmed, our Brother Keeper died from the venom of a solifuge, but there was something about this Widow Weeper that was… well, uncanny is the only word that comes to mind.”

“Oh? And why did you say nothing of this before?”

“If I am to be honest, I wasn’t quite sure I would be believed.”

None of my words seemed to surprise or even in the least bit interest the Matron. Her lips remained taut and her eyes focused on her task. “What was so strange about this solifuge that killed our Brother Keeper?”

I swallowed hard and did my best to explain, even if the words that came out didn’t quite feel right. “Well, it was there but it wasn’t. In appearance, it was just like any other Weeper, save that its skin was paler than normal, but its actions were the most unusual. It was like the Weeper knew me, or at least knew of me. It didn’t see me as a predator, it treated me more like a curiosity. And when finally I did release my last arrow, the thing disappeared into thin air.”

At this the Matron quit her writing and set down her quill. She picked her head up and looked at me sternly as I finished my account. When I was done, she seemed to deliberate for a moment, then asked, “Where was this?”

With this change in demeanor, my nerves vanished. The Matron now looked at me as she would any of the other Elders. There was respect in her eyes, if not a bit of admiration. Adjusting my posture against the chair’s rigid back, I said, “Excuse me for saying so, Matron, but I think you know where.”

The Matron leaned back in her own chair and chewed at her lip. It looked almost as if a fleeting memory were passing in front of her eyes. “I see,” she said. “Let me offer you the advice of an old crone. Any Keeper must know that what is buried is done so for a purpose. The reason may differ, of course, but it is always there. Some we bury to pay our respects. Others to contain their pestilence. Some we bury simply because we don’t know what else to do with them. But if you know your job well, my child, you will know that you have been sent here to bury what is dead, not to dig it up.”

I opened my mouth to say more but stopped myself. The Matron of the House had already returned to whatever it was she was doing before. She had said all that was to be said. “Is there anything else?” she asked.

I bowed my head and rose to my feet. “No, Matron. That is all.”

I spent many of the following days in meditation, both within the monastery and without. In time, I even let my reading pass to the wayside. Everything that I set my eyes to had become suddenly dull and worthless. Most assumed I was in mourning — some of the Elders even attempted to console me under such assumption — but when the Matron’s gaze caught my eye, it was evident that she knew different. It was our secret. One that neither of us intended to break.

Yet that did not quell my yearning to return to the catacombs. In all my musings I had, of course, considered that the Matron was trying to protect me. Though as appreciative as I was, I had not asked for her protection, nor did I feel that our interests were necessarily aligned.

I went to meditate on this as well. After supper, I went down to the graveyards and sat where I had always sat, watching the sun dip from the sky until the dust smothered it. I let my back rest against the headstone as my thoughts meandered around me and the stars began to awake from their slumber, just as all the other Keepers began to settle into theirs.

The moon was high and bold, but a steady breeze kicked up the sand around me into a haze. Perhaps that is why I did not see it at first.

I felt the heat of the air vanish and a feeling of lightness overtook me. It was a familiar sensation, one I had only felt once before. And when my eyes became as alert as my skin, I saw that the wisp had returned. Only this time, it was not alone.

All around me translucent spheres bobbed like darkened fireflies, twisting in and out of form. Occasionally, one would go out completely and another, strange but similar, would take its place. Some may have seen the sight as terrible and wicked, but to me the wavering wisps played like a ballet as they dipped and jumped around each other.

The largest of them all struck me as the most familiar. It hovered in front of me, some distance away. Again, I got the feeling I was being watched, though it was not an uncomfortable sensation. I stared at the thing unblinking, not wanting to miss a moment of its movements.

And I did not. The wisp jumped into the air and dove forward, transforming itself into an image that would have made Mariana de Valéctro come to tears: a towering sand wolf, elegant and proud in its swift stride.

The beast had at least a foot on me as I sat down and would have been able to rest its chin atop my head if I stood by it while it were on its hind legs. Its fur was a light sepia, as if it had leapt from a photograph, and though its features were large, they appeared rather indistinct.

The sand wolf stalked toward me, but I was not afraid. Nothing in its demeanor said that it would hurt me, though I was certain that it had every ability to do so.

Before I could fully comprehend what was happening, the sand wolf leapt to its feet and began prancing toward the hill of the plateau. I followed it up the incline as quickly as I could manage in my heavy robes. The sand wolf darted forward, sometimes following the trodden path, other times skirting through the brakenbushes to either side. Each time I thought I had lost it, the beast would reappear ahead of me with its jowls slyly ajar.

The wisps followed as well. The graveyard seemed to have no dearth of them. A few sped forward leaving tails of bright smolder, while others drifted along at about my pace. I held out my hand as if to let one land, but the wisps passed through me, each time leaving my skin a little lighter.

At the mouth of the catacombs’ central entrance, the wolf had disappeared. Its howls that echoed from within the caves were the beast’s only evidence of existence. I followed the noise, though I knew the path too well. A hefty gust had blown out all the torchlight, yet the wisps’ dull glow illuminated the tunnels before me.

I knew I had reached the gateway even before I rounded the corner. The hair upon the back of my neck called itself to attention as my muscles tightened. I was not quite afraid, but the thought of the Widow Weeper still haunted the recesses of my mind.

Guardedly, I entered. The room was enveloped in a soft blue hue, like light refracting through the tides of a clear sea. The wisps gathered at the domed pinnacle of the vaulted ceiling, with only a few scattered about the floor. The crystal keystone atop the doorway now glowed radiantly.

In the center of the room sat the sand wolf. I began to circle around it slowly, but as I took my first few steps the wolf sprang forward. Caught off guard, my hands leapt to my face, as if that would have done anything, yet the wolf did not reach me. As its feet left the ground, the beast swirled into a haze, collecting itself in front of me into the image of a man.

He looked vaguely familiar though I could not at first see why. Soon, I realized his robes were the same as mine. His posture was rigid but proud, and he kept his hands clasped together firmly as if to direct his body’s energy to his core. Yet surprisingly, the most familiar aspect of the man was his expression. His face was serious but calm, and his eyes were raised in a knowing way that impressed upon me true understanding over the insinuation of it. It was the same look the Matron had given me days before when I sat in her office.

I gazed at the wonder all around, though I could not find anything to say as I stepped around the room. The apparition in front of me waited patiently for my mind to calm, and even then, he only spoke to prove that words did linger about us, if I could find them.

“What is it, my child?” the man asked in a hushed utterance.

I tried to peel my eyes away from the floating wisps, but I found I could not. Without looking ahead, I returned his question. “That is my question exactly. What is this place? Who are you?”

The translucent shape remained as still as a statue. Only its lips parted, though there was no air forced through them. “It has been long since I’ve owned a name and I no longer care for one,” the man said. “But there was a time I was not unlike you. I spent many years as a Keeper, far more than you. Enough to become Elder Supreme, Master of the House. Though I have spent far more years amidst this darkness than I ever did out on the desert plains.

“As for this place, it serves as a mausoleum of memories never again to be remembered. Stories naught to be told. It is a tomb we built for ourselves and only ourselves.”

I waited for the former Master to continue, but he did not. “And yet, I am here and still alive,” I said.

“Are you?” the man asked. “You breathe, yes. And blood pumps through your veins, but you were not sent here by accident. We have watched you in the graveyards. You have taken solace in us when there are so many living you could have chosen. To whom have you told your story? It is as lost to the world as those that line these walls.”

My instinct was to become defensive, but the Master’s tone was not provocative or accusatory. It was simply an observation. I wanted to say something in response, but I knew that I had been led here to listen.

“Some time ago, we led your Matron here too. She did not tell you this, for she knew it would not change your decision. She only offered you the world as she sees it. Do not dig up the dead. For her this was truth, but is it for you?”

Now I could not help but meet the Master’s gaze. His eyes were steely and without pupils. I could not escape his stare from any angle. I felt disarmed but not quite unnerved. “What decision? What choice have you brought me here to make?”

“Your Matron made the choice she did because she felt she had a duty. She’s brilliant and a talented leader because she understands how other people feel, even if she keeps her own emotions locked within her. Perhaps even because she keeps those emotions where she most feels safe.

“But she could have made another choice. One of solitude and endless contemplation. She did not need to stay with her shovel in her hands. Her essence will stay out there, with those she has chosen to live with, even after her body ripens unto its expiration. Regardless of the life she has made for herself, in death she will pass on as little more than a wisp, wandering aimlessly amidst the rest.”

I tried to discern what the Master wanted me to do but he still stood motionless. He did all he could to keep from directing my response one way or another. He was not here to offer guidance, he was here for an answer.

“But why would you want me to bury my story here, with no one to remember me by?” I asked.

“Does one only tell a story to be heard?”

The Master spoke with a finality I had never before heard. As he did so, the wisps all around the room began to spin into a terrible cyclone of mist, which siphoned itself through the black gateway. I gazed up at the azure keystone, so bright it could nearly blind, and felt as though it were staring back.

I thought back to my life in the city. What light was there? Even in my time among the graves I had lived in a life under the cover of darkness. I knew no other way.

And yet there were many who might have called this cowardly. They may deem this way of life a refusal to overcome the pillars that have shaded me from the sun. Perhaps they would be right. But then again, does it not take courage to do more than endure? To find satisfaction in the way of things, rather than battle all of one’s days in the name of change?

Even now, I do not have the answers. Neither do the Matron of the House nor any Master of the Dead. We have only our choices, and the resonance of their outcomes.

Saying no more, the Master began to walk toward the gateway of darkness. Too bewildered to move, I let his form pass right through me, along with those of the many wisps that began to filter out of the room. I looked down at my skin which grew paler as each light whirled by.

I knew I could not stay there. And so, slowly, I walked into the darkness. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> The rules of the game were simple but nearly impossible to master.

Two opponents sit three yards apart. In their hand a small dagger; dug into the earth in front of them is a longer, steel sword. You cannot kill an opponent with the dagger, so long as they remain seated. You can kill them with the sword, though, even if they do not move. Going for the sword means you stand, and are vulnerable. Your opponent can strike a knife blow, often thrown, and kill you. The game only ends when one challenger fells the other. It is a bloodsport without mercy. While sat, you are given no food; no water. You cannot take a break, you cannot sleep, you cannot take your eye off your opponent. A slip, a mistake, a yawn too long, and your rival can grab the sword and slay you. But, you must be cautious. Winners have been known to feign a tired eye, or a lingering blink. Seemingly unprepared, but in fact ready for the kill.

It’s a game of wits, a game of risk and a game of luck.

Having an off day is something we all do experience; maybe we’re feeling unwell or are just not ourselves. But an off day in the Crucible of Steel will likely be your last. And most matches last that, a day. Some can go on much longer though, until fatigue or dehydration wins out. In a recent match, lasting just shy of four days, one of the challengers fell asleep, unable to keep his heavy eyelids open any longer. Perhaps he welcomed eternal rest after the torment of The Crucible. But, when his rival stood to grasp the hilt of the blade, his weakness caught his knees, his dry mouth burned fiercely, and he fainted. The thud he made hitting the floor woke his opponent, long enough for him to inch his way over to the sword and bury it deep within his opponent’s neck.

The Crucible of Steel turns everyone weak, even those thought strongest of all. No mental fortitude, no years of training, can prepare you for days of no sleep or water, whilst another sits just out of reach, willing your imminent demise. Many fear exactly that, looking weak in front of the crowds. So, instead, they elect for quicker matches; but this rarely ends well. A mighty man, towering above his small, spindly assailant, muscles barely contained within his required garment of a black sleeveless top, will fall just as easily as their match when a blade is driven through their breastbone. Often, it pays to leave your ego beyond The Crucible. While for some, confidence has been enough to intimidate their opponents and led to an easy victory, more often than not, it proves folly. As is the nature of the game, very few live long enough to become a legend of the sport, yet those few that do honour patience and a level head above anything else.

The people who set the matches like to put these victors against each other when possible. They like to see how winners work against other winners. Some rivals chat, some stare blankly at each other or avoid gazes. Others try to talk to a stone faced figure. Even the best bookmakers have trouble predicting match results. Friendly-souls have severed many heads. Quiet, stoic and threatening types have both taken home streaks of victories and just as often been dispatched within 20 minutes.

Not that the spectators complain of quick matches though. Off all the sports we watch and endure, The Crucible of Steel is perhaps both the dullest and the most exciting. There is nothing like the tension of two combatants, locked in a fight to the death, watching each other intently, waiting to strike. But there is also nothing so dull as sitting on a wooden podium for days, waiting for one single masterstroke. It is thought a match will usually last an hour or two, or a day or more if it goes beyond that. Many spectators will watch the early moments, then leave to go about their normal lives, returning every now and then to check in. Only those placing large wagers will stay for the entirety of the fight; them, and the families of those fighting. They are always sat behind their loved ones. They weren’t allowed to be within easy viewing; it thought it gives the contestant an advantage in morale.

It was quite rare for families to be in The Crucible of Steel though, mainly because combatants didn’t usually have loved ones to witness their triumph or execution. Most were convicts or prisoners, given an opportunity at freedom if victorious. Depending on the crime, you may have to win more than one fight, though. Cossar the murderer was famously tasked with seventeen wins, one for every woman he killed. He lost fight two… Others enter for the glory of their house and home, a right of passage for warriors, although this practice is dying out. Too many good fighters training their whole lives to die for nothing. Some combatants play for money. It pays well to win, and if poverty is your only fortune, The Crucible could feed you for a few months, even years if you defeat a champion. Then there are those very few, unhinged humans, offering themselves purely for the thrill; the risk.

One such fight, between two combatants who fought each other for no more than sheer joy, is touted as the longest on record. They entered on a cool morning, paraded before the hundreds of spectators, before taking up position in their small, open-air colosseum. Because they weren’t poor, they’d both eaten well before the match, and favourable weather, including some nourishing rain, allowed them to carry on their tense duel for days on end. Five days after entering, they were both still sat there. Bleary-eyed, swaying slightly off centre, rubbing their lower backs in pain, but very much alive. True fans of the sport had been camped out ever since they overtook the previous record. Waiting for that killing blow. Tensions started to rise mid-afternoon of the sixth day. Things were looking bleak for the two men. Both had sobbed and cursed their decision. The mental decay of no sleep, combined with the reality of the situation — that one would die, yet neither had to — had finally sunk in. A light breeze licked the air, and suddenly one of the men’s noses began to twitch. The prevailing wind had caught him and he was struggling to suppress a sneeze. People drew in closer as he scrunched up his nose, bit his lip and tried desperately not to let it out. But he could hold it no longer, he closed his eyes, let out a mighty sneeze and before he could open them again, had a 30-inch blade struck through his stomach. It was hard to have sympathy for a man who had thrown his life away for the sheer experience of The Crucible, but he was still given a champions burial for his heroic efforts in the arena. The victor collapsed upon exiting the match and died, presumably of exhaustion.

He was buried facing his opponent, so they could continue their epic match for eternity.

Considering the fact one of the duelists had been victorious, it seemed odd to leave them battling for the rest of time. Yet, it is the poetry and supposed romance of this event that really draws people in. A prisoner gaining his freedom, the widow making her living. People loved an underdog story, they also loved a champion. It was as much an act of wonder as it was a ritualistic way of controlling the population. Prior to their match, the combatants hold rallies before crowds, describing their life and talking about why they were entering. Some spoke with fear, some spoke with desperation, others with pride, excitement or hope. It was very theatrical, especially when a performer decided to get involved. A leading lady of a local troupe had been caught stealing jewels from drunk patrons stumbling home after a show. She’d opted for the fight, to allow her to get back to the stage and continue to do the work she loved, as she emphatically put it. She created quite a stir with her flair for drama in the run-up to her ‘big show’. She died rather dramatically, too. Taking to the sword with a characteristically wide and over-acted swing, she caught a knife to the throat and bled out slowly, whimpering. It was something of a relief. The streets were quieter for it all being over.

She’d tried to get through the event using her theatrical skills. Acting as though she was already victorious. It didn’t work. Champions over the years have told others of how they managed the situation mentally. Some try to blank out the experience, thinking of nothing, instead just watching for movement or weakness. Then there are those that try and build their bodies into a state of heightened fear. Pumping the adrenaline, they can keep alert and move fast. Others said the terror would ruin them. Instead, they try to disconnect themselves from the experience, acting as though they aren’t actually involved in it at all. Running stories through their minds. One even spoke of how they would describe The Crucible of Steel in great detail in their own head, recounting its history, its structure and how the game is played, as if playing the part of a guide to a foreigner. Telling them about how it all plays out.

Anything to make them feel as if they weren’t actually sat there, waiting to die. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> Iris eyed the interior of the carriage with caution as the train came to a screeching halt. Potions clinked against the clamps which held them in their travel positions, but didn’t come loose in a crash of shattering glass. A wheeled cart smashed against the wall it was tied to, yet failed to dislodge from its bindings and turn into a bludgeoning projectile.

There was still the other carriage, the one that served as a workshop instead of a storefront, but Aunt was inside of it. Aunt had decades more experience with combustible potions than she did.

Which meant that everything had arrived intact, and Iris could allow herself to relax.

The creak of metal hinges signaled Aunt’s arrival though the carriage door. The older woman set a brisk pace for the glass cabinets, bolted in place. Iris rushed to help in unclasping the vials, knowing they had a small window of time before the train announced its arrival to potential customers.

“You will be on your own, so remember never to open the orange potions,” Aunt lectured her. “I specifically color the dangerous ones orange.”

“I know,” Iris said, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. She was not going to magically forget everything she’d learned in the past few years just because Aunt didn’t remind her.

“And if a customer becomes unruly — ”

“Aunt, I know.”

Aunt stopped loosening one of the clasps and turned piercing gray eyes upon her apprentice. “Iris,” she admonished. “You may believe nothing will go wrong. Most likely, nothing will go wrong. But there is a real possibility of danger, and if that should happen . . . what would you even do?” A glint of concern appeared behind her eyes. “Perhaps I should stay.”

Alarm rose within Iris. “No, no, I’m sorry! I am taking this seriously. I even have a list of all your instructions written down.”

What would she do if Aunt decided not to visit her friend after all? If she continued to hover over the shop, watching Iris’s work, she would intercept customers before Iris could handle them! How long would it be before Iris had another opportunity for freedom, where her every move did not need to meet with Aunt’s approval?

Aunt’s sharp eyes raked over her apprentice’s apologetic form. “All right,” the woman finally said, the words like a weight being lifted. “Hurry up, then, and get this dreary place decorated.”

Iris threw herself into the work with alacrity. Ropes were removed, vials repositioned, ribbons hung. Before long, the carriage looked less like a collection space and more like a cozy little shop, lined with elaborate glass bottles containing deep-colored liquids.

Aunt slid open a doorway at the width of the carriage, while Iris carried a wooden ramp to place over it. Splinters dug into her skin as she lowered the ramp, almost dropping it as the low note of a horn thrummed through the air, echoing towards the white spires and winding streets of the nearby city.

The anticipation coursed through Iris. Customers would close their own businesses and postpone their day’s plans at the instrument’s call. The entire city would flock to the Evanescent Market, a spectacle arriving by railway, not to be seen again for years.

She finished with the ramp, smoothed out her plain but presentable dress, then took a few steps back to survey their work.

The words ‘Goodstone’s Elixary’ adorned the side of the carriage in a neat cursive, the white letters contrasting nicely against the dark blue coloring of the train. Strategically placed lamps trailing blue and green ribbons lit the interior. The air carried the lightest hint of citrus, emanating from the fragrance vials Aunt situated around the shop.

It was ready. It was perfect. And if only for today, it was all hers.

By the time the first customers arrived — the ones enterprising enough to beat the rush — Aunt was gone. And if the memory of Aunt’s concerns raised any doubts in Iris’s mind about what she was truly in for, they were quickly swept away by the thrill of independence.

“Welcome to Goodstone’s Elixary,” she called with a little too much cheer, as a middle-aged woman ascended the ramp. “Is there something in particular you were looking for?”

The woman tossed a self-conscious gaze around the carriage. “Relief from nightmares,” she said.

“Ah, yes, we have that.” Iris strode away from the displays of the more impressive potions near the entrance towards the stocks of practical ones in the back. She picked up a small vial filled with a cloudy black liquid, the cool glass fitting neatly into the palm of her hand. “Dreamless Sleep. Add a few drops to a cup of hot water — tea will do as well — and it should curtail dreams for several days. It may be taken as needed, but not more than once a day.”

The woman paid for three, and pride welled inside of Iris as the coins touched her palm. It was a modest sale, but a respectable one. And it was her first. The first customer she’d ever handled alone.

This precious milestone in Iris’s life made a furtive escape down the ramp, as a pair of younger men — barely past boyhood, with curious eyes — wandered in. The cabinets of brightly-colored potions by the entryway caught their attention. Excited whispers flowed from their lips as they pointed out the labels to each other.

“Look, it says Breath of Fire,” one said.

“And Interrupted Time. What do you think that means?”

Iris immediately dismissed them as browsers. They wished to peruse the more interesting wares, which they wouldn’t have a use for even if they could afford them. Perhaps once they made their way towards the back, they might be tempted into buying some trifles. Best to leave them alone for now.

Behind them, a gentleman followed, dark coattails trailing behind him as he removed his hat. From the shine of his shoes to his gleaming gem buttons, everything about him declared his wealth. A man like this, while perhaps not looking for the sort of potions the young men were studying, could spend quite a bit of money. If Iris managed to direct him towards an item that intrigued him.

Aunt had never let her handle such a valuable customer before, even with her help.

“Welcome to Goodstone’s Elixary,” she began, surreptitiously slipping her coins into the pouch dangling from her belt. “Is there something I can help you find?”

The man raised an eyebrow as he noted her appearance, perhaps not expecting a girl her age to manage the shop alone. Iris only straightened her shoulders and turned up her smile in response. He would be impressed soon enough.

“There is something I am interested in,” he said, tone impassive. “What in this shop can alter reality?”

Iris blinked at the unusual request, uncertain of what he meant. “We have all sorts of potions to transport you into a different world. Endless Ocean, or Mountain Peak, or The City of Crystal. . .”

The man gave a contemptuous sniff. “Paltry illusions.”

Iris kept her smile up through sheer force of will and hoped he wouldn’t notice it growing brittle. She had only just learned to mix Endless Ocean herself and was quite proud of the results. “Then might you be thinking of something that disrupts gravitational forces, or transforms one material into another?”

“What nonsense,” the man replied. “You offer me children’s tricks.”

Those were most assuredly not children’s tricks — they were time consuming and expensive recipes that had to be crafted with great care, lest they fail to work or explode. This man had asked her for something that altered reality. How did bending the physical forces that shaped their world not qualify?

“Perhaps you might give me a better indication of what you’re looking for?” Iris asked.

He turned to the nearest cabinet, tracing the label for Upward Plunge with a gloved fingertip. “I have no need of trifles that affect some tiny radius. That hardly changes the world at all. Now, strumming the strings of time . . . that is a worthy magic.”

Latching onto the new information, Iris rushed to say, “We have items such as Interrupted Time to slow everything in — ”

“Stop,” he cut her off, voice rising. “I said that I am uninterested in your tiny radius. Or in something as meager as slowing down time. You shall show me where you keep your potions for traveling to the past. By about an hour, I believe, is the usual amount?”

Iris froze, suddenly noting a predatory glint in the man’s eyes. Uncertainty washed over her, because who would ask for something like that, who would even think that something like that existed . . .

A fleeting thought passed through her mind that Aunt should be the one dealing with this. But no, she didn’t need Aunt. She was perfectly capable of handling this on her own.

“That’s impossible,” she told him, drawing on all the defiance she could muster. “We craft nothing capable of undoing time.”

“You would want it to be accessible in an emergency, but nonetheless difficult to find,” the man continued, ignoring her words completely. “Where is it, child?”

He took a step towards the little desk Iris used for accounting — it was the only place in the carriage not intended for customers. Iris gathered her courage and moved directly into his path, refusing to let him intimidate her. He paused, an amused gleam shining from behind his eyes.

“I’m right, aren’t I?” he said. “You keep it here.”

Circling around her to reach the desk, he began searching through the papers atop it, peeking underneath it. Iris tried to take a subtle step towards the nearest cabinet, accepting that he would not stop until she made him. A potion like Interrupted Time would give her quite the advantage.

Without even looking up, the man lifted an arm in her direction — and all of her muscles locked into place.

“Stay put,” he admonished. “I may need you yet.”

A sudden panic fell over her as she strained to move, yet remained stuck in place. How could he do this? Affect her so powerfully without the aid of a medium? He wasn’t simply some wealthy customer. He was a magician.

She truly wished Aunt were here now, her own pride notwithstanding.

He continued rifling through the desk, leaving Iris trapped in helpless fear — and confusion. For why would a magician need anything from them? Why bother with the bottled magic of an elixary? He could do anything they could, and fuel it with his own reserves rather than their complicated recipes.

What motive could he have? He’d expressed a desire to go backwards in time. Magicians were powerful, but Aunt had warned her that they liked to exaggerate their power. Perhaps this was something he couldn’t do for himself?

The magician shoved her accounting books off the table in a sudden show of frustration. The clatter drew the attention of the youngsters, who’d moved a bit further into the carriage. Turning away from the vials, their eyes landed upon Iris’s form, frozen in mid-motion.

“What’s going on?” one of them asked.

The man flicked a wrist, and their eyes drifted shut as both of them slumped to the ground. Iris managed a gasp of horror before her throat closed from whatever spell had trapped her.

How was this happening? They were a small-scale elixary, talented enough, but not worth the attention of anyone this powerful. The truly impressive elixaries were private, held by noblemen and royals who retained the services of their own practitioners. Goodstone’s Elixary should never have attracted the notice of a powerful magician. Their poor customers should never have so much as breathed the same air as this walking menace. And yet these two young men were paying for it.

“Oh, do not be so dramatic,” the magician grumbled, perhaps noticing her terror. “They are merely unconscious. But there are no potions here that I can find. Where are you hiding them?”

He straightened, and suddenly the spell holding her in place dropped. With her muscles unready to hold her weight, Iris’s body plummeted against the nearest cabinet. Her shoulder crashed into the wood, throbbing from the impact, as she struggled to lift herself into a sitting position.

“I told you,” she insisted in a shaky voice. “We have nothing like that.”

The magician gave a disappointed sigh. “You persist in lying to me.”

He moved closer, towering over her, and she tensed. But instead of turning to her, he reached for the cabinet. A flash of orange came from above her as he removed a potion — she recognized it as Searing Heat.

“This is a nice one to light a fire with, for those pathetic enough to require outside assistance,” the magician mused. “What do you think should happen if it touched your skin?”

If she had felt fear at the loss of her ability to move, it was nothing compared to what she felt now. This man was a monster. She felt a clawing desperation in her chest, a trembling over her entire body, as he dipped the bottle . . .

Then he tilted it back up, placing it back inside the cabinet. “But that would be rather boring, no? Let us find something more inventive.”

She had seconds to act, before he found something worse. Seconds. And this was not a normal emergency. This was life or death. It was time for the most drastic of actions, for whatever it took to escape him.

Her hand slipped into the pouch at the side of her dress, reaching for a plain tube filled with a pale white potion. A dull color, so as not to tempt customers. Before the magician had a chance to look down and stop her, she opened it and downed its contents, the viscous liquid sliding down her throat.

A middle-aged woman stood near the entrance of the carriage, gazing with suspicion at her surroundings. “Relief from nightmares,” she said, her voice so soft it was almost a whisper.

Iris felt a wave of disorientation, slowly realizing her fist was clenched around a cool glass tube. An empty glass tube. With a sudden anxiety, she rifled through her pouch, looking for Second Chance. It was gone.

And then the memories came flooding back to her, along with a terror that nearly swept her away.

The magician had been right, in that Aunt kept a single massively valuable dose of Second Chance in the shop at all times. He had been under the impression it would give back an hour of the user’s time and Iris wondered where he’d heard such a thing. The mix Aunt made was only capable of restoring thirty minutes.

Yet those thirty minutes cost dearly, and Iris found herself overwhelmed that she’d used it at all. Months of crafting, rare ingredients which Iris wouldn’t know how to acquire herself, all spent on this one dose of potion. It was not for sale. Even the knowledge that Aunt had the ability to make it was immensely dangerous — as today’s events insisted on proving.

Now it was gone. Used up. The empty tube had come with Iris when she traveled back from the future. There would be no more second chances, no emergency potion to save her from the coming danger.

How long did she have? Ten, fifteen minutes until the magician once again stepped foot into the shop?

The thought nearly sent her into a panic, for what was she supposed to do? He was so strong, while Aunt was too far away to help. She dared not risk her neighbors by involving them. And the ephemeral nature of their traveling market meant that Iris didn’t know where to find local help, didn’t have regular customers to rely on.

Run, came a voice in the back of her mind. Run, and you will live.

But then this magician would have free access to everything in Aunt’s shop. Second Chance was the single greatest potion in the elixary’s arsenal, true, but it was not the only powerful item Aunt kept hidden. If Iris allowed him to take them . . .

Then collect those items and flee, the voice insisted.

In ten minutes? She would never make it. And even if she did, the magician could spring a trap on Aunt upon her return.

She can handle him better than you can.

But Iris was certain that Aunt couldn’t handle him. He was far too powerful, and his magic was innate, rather than derived from craftwork. To have any chance against him, Aunt would require time to prepare, and he would give her none.

This left Iris with the decision of whether to doom Aunt, or endanger herself.

Why had she ever thought she was ready for this? Why had she believed that, because she could handle the shop under Aunt’s watchful gaze, she could manage anything that came her way? This was not what she had imagined at all.

“Miss?” the middle-aged woman questioned.

“Ah, yes,” Iris answered absently. “I will be with you in a moment.”

Aunt was not here to make things better, the way she always had been in the past. She had entrusted the shop to Iris. And if Iris did not live up to her expectations, she would come back to unimaginable danger.

There had to be something Iris could do. Scrambling over to the cabinets, she read over the labels, searching for inspiration. Something like Searing Heat would never work, for she would have to hit him with the potion somehow. Interrupted Time afforded him too much opportunity to counterattack . . .

“Excuse me,” the woman said again, irritation bleeding into her voice.

“Dreamless Sleep,” Iris replied, waving a hand towards the back. “Two cabinets over.”

Then she paused. Dreamless Sleep. A few drops to lessen dreams, a few more to dull emotions, a bottle to turn off the mind for days. That was it.

She had barely enough time to fetch and hide a vial before the young men arrived, halting at the nearest cabinet to marvel at its contents. And after them, adopting a more leisurely pace, followed the magician.

There was only so much Iris could predict. She had already caused the woman with nightmares to stay long enough to cross paths with this dangerous man. But if she acted as normally as possible, she would know the general direction events might take.

“Here,” she said to the woman, moving to pass her another vial of Dreamless Sleep. “Apologies for the delay.”

The magician perused the store’s wares while money exchanged hands. As the woman exited into safety, Iris turned her attention to the gentleman. Any confidence she’d tricked herself into disappeared at the sight of his stony eyes, the amused tilt of his lips.

“May I help you?” Iris asked, trying not to choke on the words.

“You may,” he informed her. “I should like to see an item which changes reality.”

She tried to recall what she’d told him before. “Are you looking to affect physical forces such as gravity, or — ”

“No, no, no. Not gravity, and none of those cheap radial effects either, please. Impress me with something beyond the bounds of what you place on your shelves.”

Heart pounding, Iris adopted her best quizzical expression. “But everything we sell is on the shelves.”

“Do not toy with me, child,” he said, voice dropping to a tone that sent shivers down her spine. What had she been thinking? Why hadn’t she run while she had the chance? “I know the sorts of things a good elixary can hide. And what but a good elixary can secure itself a coveted spot on the Evanescent Train?”

Iris swallowed over the lump in her throat, unsure what to do with him veering off script like this. “Sir, I am but an apprentice. I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

His eyes fell on her desk. Good. Oh, good.

The heel of his shoe clanked as he stepped towards it, and Iris — forcing herself to remember her earlier boldness, putting aside the thought of how easily he could hurt her — moved into his path, staring him down for all the world like she wasn’t a terrified girl pretending to be brave.

But she had to do it. This very action was why he’d believed there was something hidden in the desk the first time around.

“I am right, am I not? It’s here.” He swept past her, descending on the desk, searching its contents — and finding a tiny black bottle hidden inside. “And what is this unassuming little thing?”

A tiny bit of relief came over her as he found the bottle, even as she knew it to be premature, even as her task only became harder from here. She had no insight left into what would happen next.

“Sir, that isn’t for sale,” she said, telling herself that the tremor in her voice was deliberate.

His condescending eyes met hers, but he made no move to leave with the bottle or drink it. “Tell me what it is.”

Only then did she grasp how rushed this plan was, how badly thought out. He had not even mentioned the properties of Second Chance specifically this time. All he knew was that she kept this potion hidden from customers. He would not drink it without knowing what it was. Even if he did believe this was Second Chance, she would still be unable to coax him into drinking it now instead of when he’d truly need it.

Which left Iris with the unenviable task of getting him to leave peaceably, imagining himself satisfied.

“It’s nothing,” she told him. “It is one of my own failed attempts to replicate an advanced recipe. Please, don’t injure yourself by consuming it.”

That wasn’t enough. It couldn’t possibly be enough. But at least he would believe she didn’t want him to drink it.

A beleaguered sigh escaped from the magician. “Why must you make this so difficult? Very well.”

He raised an arm and the two youngsters dropped just as they had before. The act left Iris less shaken than it had the first time around, as she was already aware that they still lived. Unless this time was different. A creeping doubt found its way into her heart, as she contemplated how much had changed already. What if they were truly dead?

“Don’t hurt the customers,” she said, her voice coming out in a squeak.

“I haven’t hurt anyone yet,” the man replied. “They merely sleep. What do you imagine it might take to wake them up?” He shifted towards the nearest cabinet, the same one as before, his fingers tracing the labels of the potions. “Searing Heat? Too boring.”

“Please don’t hurt them,” she beseeched, hoping to buy enough time to figure this out. Events were progressing slower than before — or perhaps it only felt that way because she wasn’t the one in immediate danger.

The magician paused. “Then give me a reason not to,” he said. “Tell me what the potion is for. Tell me what other secrets are hidden in this elixary.”

A desperate idea came to her. It might not work. But it was all she had. “I have no knowledge of the secrets hidden in the elixary.”

A gentle chuckle emanated from the gentleman. “No? Would your mistress leave you here without making that knowledge available to you? What if some dapper gentleman came to cause trouble?”

“I don’t know her secrets,” she repeated, the desperation in her tone real even if her words weren’t. “I truly don’t.”

“Then she must have left you a way to access them as needed,” he replied in his deceptively calm voice. “An inventory of some sort.”

Iris deliberately cast her eyes upon the Dreamless Sleep potion in the man’s hand, attempting to make the gesture seem unconscious.

“This?” the magician asked, a note of delight in his voice. “A memory potion, containing the inventory to her secrets?”

“No,” Iris said, lacing the word with horror. “That isn’t — sir, it isn’t safe. Please don’t drink that.”

And he laughed, an airy sound that chimed through the air. It was far too handsome a laugh for so terrible a man. Removing the cork from the bottle, he drank the contents in deep gulps. Then he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his mouth and asked, “How long before it takes effect?” As the last word left his lips, he listed to the side. A cloudy realization appeared behind his eyes. “What did you do?”

Iris backed up a few steps, wary.

“You drugged me,” he said, with a quiet fury. Bracing himself against the cabinet, his previous grace gone as his body lost its coordination, he raised a hand in Iris’s direction.

She bolted for the door, hoping to evade him until he lost consciousness. A few minutes had seemed like such a short amount of time for the potion to take effect before, yet now it felt far too long.

A wave of pressure passed by her, close enough to graze her arm and send her veering into another cabinet face first. Her cheek collided with the edge in an explosion of pain. Pushing away, turning back towards the magician, she found him slumping down the cabinet to the ground. His eyes were unfocused, but his arm still rose in the direction of the doorway. She watched as a blast of air emanated from his hand, shattering the glass of the nearest cabinet — and the closest potion.

Orange liquid poured over the side of the cabinet, dripping onto the bits of shattered glass on the floor. As the first drop touched a shard, it launched itself diagonally into the air, taking only an instant to lodge itself into the ceiling.

Upward Plunge. But despite the name, the potion did not quite reverse gravity. It was not precise enough for that. Instead, it changed the flow of gravity in a generally upward but often tilted direction. That meant it was safest to duck while it was in effect.

Of course, the rows of potions sitting in the potential path of these glass projectiles did not have the capacity to duck. And if even one more potion bottle broke, Iris might have yet another disaster on her hands.

She had to neutralize Upward Plunge.

But Reassert Gravity was located in the same cabinet as Upward Plunge, sitting directly behind the broken vial, and to reach it she would place herself in the way of the glass shards. The pool of orange liquid on the ground grew with every additional drip, expanding towards the collection of shards on the floor. The danger to her person was clear.

But if the wrong potion broke, it could cause an explosion, or overdose all of them with a sleeping agent they might never wake up from. Even potions which might harmlessly disperse in open air would become lethal in such a small, enclosed space. This was the price they paid for traveling with the Evanescent Market. Never before had it felt quite so high.

Iris dashed for the cabinet, flinching as another glass projectile sped past her and embedded itself into the wall with a light thud. Her fingertips brushed against the glass containing the clear blue fluid of Reassert Gravity, just as a sudden sting in her arm had her hissing in pain. A glance down revealed a trail of red where another shard had grazed her — she was fortunate it hadn’t hit her neck or chest instead.

Terrified that the flying glass might be the end of her at any moment, Iris uncorked the potion with one hand and poured it over the splotch of orange on the ground with the other. Heart in her throat, she watched as the colors blended into a dull brown, inactivating the effects of Upward Plunge.

Her gaze turned towards the magician, whose eyes had finally closed, whose hands were finally resting against the ground.

Iris let out a breath of unparalleled relief that turned into a sob midway. By all the world’s enchantments, it was finally over. Finally safe.

He would remain unconscious for days at least, and by then Aunt would be back to fix this mess. Disposing of powerful strangers with discretion was not something Iris had been taught, and only now did she understand how much she had left to learn before she could run an elixary on her own.

She had not been ready for this. She could not have imagined how much she wasn’t ready for this. So many mistakes, so many rushed plans.

But she could do better.

She could formulate a series of contingencies. Review the inventory again with an eye for how each item may be useful in an emergency. Seed little traps throughout the shop like she did with Dreamless Sleep.

She had not been ready for this, but she’d survived it anyway. And she would make sure that the next time something like this happened, her victory would not be so precarious. <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> A courtyard of fine stone, set in large slabs across a perfectly flat ground.
Around three of its edges was wrapped a great hall, two stories high and topped
with a slanted tile roof. Its stone was carved just as finely, if not smoother than the
slabs. Yet it’s colour was much deeper, and set within it were many small windows,
panes split by delicate strands of woodwork. Against the furthest edge of the
square courtyard was a castle. A small yet striking stronghold, it’s stonework craggy
and much rougher than all that which lay around it. The castle was old and worn,
yet still looked sturdy and hardened. It towered above the square, two great
blackened turrets sat like billowing smoke plumes either side of a lofty gatehouse
topped with ramparts.
The two turrets were connected to the great hall on either side by arches that
ran over two corners of the courtyard. Their tunnels led out into much larger fortress
the square was set around. The tunnels were the only way in, or out.
On a summer’s day, the courtyard was quite beautiful. Ivy crept from the cracks
in the castle’s foundations up its ageing form, as flowers sat on window ledges of
the hall brightening the grey stone scene. Today though, darkness clutched the
overcast sky and heavy rain battered the ground, deepening the already dark
colours and casting an unyieldingly ominous shadow over the expanse. The smell
of the downpour permeated the air, hugging the nostrils and damping the spirits. To
march around in thick leather and heavy chainmail, all clasped together with a thick
steel breastplate and a latched plate girdle was one thing on a dry day, but in the
harsh rain, every step was slower and harder. The last thing you wanted on a day
like today. Farrow wished for the summer sun. Wished to see this courtyard in its
beautiful state one more time, but he knew he never would. In that moment, he was
reminded why.
A crack, unlike anything he’d heard before, struck the air like lightning and sent
him recoiling backwards. His movement was a stroke of luck, as he narrowly
avoided being crushed by chunks of falling stone, large as a man, that had been
torn from one of the turrets above and sent hurtling towards the ground, slamming
into the pristine courtyard stone and splitting its smooth surface. He looked up in
time to see the culprit swoop around for the other tower.
A bird, a massive bird, its wingspan so large it may have eclipsed even the
width of the castle itself, dove from above and reached out with enormous black
talons, ripping into the stone of the castle’s battlements and tearing them asunder
with such ease it was akin to a man running his palm through sand. The birds
black, shimmering feathers were jagged, serrated and spun together more like a
thick coat of scales than a soft plume: a stonecrow. As it flew away, sending more
stone tumbling to the ground, this time from the gatehouse, it let out a cruel and
vicious screech. In seconds, the once proud and intimidating stronghold had
become a ruin. Much of its upper ramparts torn away. A bastion of safety turned a
battered and bruised wreck. Farrow marvelled at the damage so swiftly inflicted.
The doors of the castle swung open. Two men, clad in finely gilded armour,
clutching barbed polearms and adorned with golden tabards, streaked out from
behind them before the iron was quickly slammed shut and bolted. They paced
down the stairs leading up to the castle and inspected the damage. Soon, their
eyes fell upon Farrow, who simply gazed back at them.
“What you doing?” One of the men roared through the downpour, pulling off his
helmet as rain pinged loudly off the metal. “Why aren’t you on the wall?”
Just as he spoke, the stonecrow made another pass at the castle, tearing yet
more chunks from its roof, this time lunging at stonework on the other side of the
building. As it took off into the air once more, arrows released from bowmen well
out of sight flew through the air, pinging off its wings like chucked pebbles
ricocheting off a wall.
The three men, alone in the courtyard, watched as the terrifying creature peeled
off and faded into the murk of the low-lying clouds above. Their eyes followed the
dark figure through the sky as its silhouette was occasionally outlined in the lighter
patches of sky. Then, it was gone.
The two men before Farrow, royal guards of the castle, turned on him once
more.
“Well?” The first demanded.
“My mother used to bring me to this courtyard when I was a boy. We’d watch the
jugglers and the tricksters do their magic, and listen to the lutes while women
sang.” Farrow replied calmly, seemingly unaffected by the anger rising on the
guard’s face.
“Have you lost your mind soldier?” He bellowed. “Get back down there and
fight.”
“I used to love it here. The bright flowers.” Farrow continued, paying no attention
to his words. “I just wanted to come back for a fond memory. One last time.”
“You’ll get your wish!” The other guard said, moving in. “Once this is over I’ll
make sure they hang you in this very spot.”
Farrow laughed.
“I haven’t come here because I’m a coward. I’ve come here to die somewhere I
love.”
42
The guards looked at each other and at that moment, the realisation hit them. It
was not Farrow’s words, not even the stonecrow that once again appeared above,
this time doing nothing but making a sickening pass as it glowered over the
courtyard. No. It was the sound of the stampede. Of the boots against the ground
as both tunnelled archways began to fill with men. Soldiers, swords in hand.
Their numbers were but a few, maybe a hundred, maybe less. Thousands had
swarmed the walls and turrets and battlements not thirty minutes ago, so many had
fallen, and most that returned were bloodied and badly wounded. Yet their return
was not victorious either, these men were fleeing, and in their wake paced
creatures of a nightmare. A dozen hounds, maybe more, the size of horses, broad
like lumbermen and teeth gnashing, tore through the stragglers as they barrelled
into the tunnels. Their deep black fur made them almost invisible in the gloom of
the arches, but their clear white eyes shone through. Even if they hadn’t, the
screams would have been reassurance enough that they were there, and getting
closer.
The stonecrow made another pass the courtyard filled with soldiers, pressing
their backs towards Farrow and forming a defensive line in a fruitless attempt to
repel the massive dogs. This time the bird struck the great hall, diving low and
tearing off enormous chunks of stone that cascaded down upon the embattled men,
crushing more than a few. They were being ripped apart from either side. There
was no escape for these men. Tunnels led beneath the castle and out into the wilds
beyond, but as Farrow watched the shimmering gold of the royal guard disappear
behind the gates, he knew that iron plate upon iron plate would be fixed to the
entrance, baring all from a way inside. It wouldn’t take long for the hounds to break
down, nor the stonecrow to rip the entire structure to pieces, but long enough for
those inside to make an escape.
Those out here, in the tormented twilight, would not be so lucky. None would
see dawn.
Farrow etched backwards as one of the mighty hounds broke the swiftly
thinning defensive line with a swipe of its razored paw, all while shredding a solider
between its jaws. With a deep and accepting breath, he turned away from the
chaos. If he could’ve closed out the horrific noise, it would have been a peaceful
scene. Rain simply falling methodically on the empty courtyard floor. Somehow,
through the thick spell of clouds coursing above the square, a streak of sunlight
managed to pierce the haze. It fell upon a window ledge of the hall, and bathed a
patched of drooping flowers sat atop it. Farrow approached, throwing off his steel
gauntlets and reaching his hand out into the warmth of the light. He brushed his
fingertips against the petals. Closing his eyes, and offering a gentle smile, he tried
to sooth his pounding heart and shaking limbs. He took a moment to appreciate his
breath, the feel of the soft flowers on his skin. The warm of the sunlight. But then
the warmth faded. He opened his eyes, the streak of sunlight had gone, the gloom
had returned.
He felt a tug on his shoulder. Then a crunch as his armour concaved. A
pressure welled around his sides. The last he heard was the growl.
 <|endoftext|> 
 <|startoftext|> “How does it look?”

Carefully, I gripped my companion by the shoulder and pulled him away from the slippery stone wall. He left behind stains of blood on the cobalt rock; strands, thick and black, sticking to where he once rested. In the flickering firelight, what little I could see was pure horror. Three deep gashes, each about three inches apart, were scored across his back from left waist to right shoulder. A mess of torn flesh, muscle and tendons, he had been ripped to the bone, right through his thick furs and leathers. In the freezing temperatures, the blood seemed to flow less willingly, but this made the injury no less grim. Slowly, I let him roll back to his resting place against the wall of the cave. The heat from the fire warmed the rock that encased us, forming droplets of water that either dripped from the jagged ceiling or slid their way down the curved wall. I wiped my hands on the moisture, trying to remove some of the blood that coated them.

“I’ve seen worse”.

“On a gutted pig?” He chuckled breathlessly, his voice rattling.

“You just need rest. The wound will heal enough by morning.”

He gave another, hollow laugh and smiled, a crooked, disbelieving smile.

“You make it pay, won’t you?”

“We will.” I insisted, putting my hand on his shoulder.

I looked the dying man in the eye, hoping that some of my confidence would inspire him to keep on fighting. He just gazed back, his eyelids drooping. I could tell he was tired. So very, very tired. He didn’t seem to have the energy to fight, or to even care that he was facing his last moments. Harsh winds wailed past the entrance to the cave. A blizzard was tearing through the night beyond our little shelter. I could feel the bitterness of the frozen world outside. The dwindling fire a meagre offering compared to the unrelenting nightmare of snow; little protection against the sharp, icy winds that crept their way into our abode.

By the time dawn broke, I was huddled in the deepest corner of the cave, wrapped tightly in the fur cloak I had thought would keep me warm in these unforgiving mountains. My companion lay dead, taken either by his wounds or the ice that encrusted his lips and eyelashes. The fire had died about the same time he did. So long ago that it no longer even smouldered. The blizzard had cleared, but snow still fell. It almost never stopped falling in the mountains. In a stupor of hunger and sleep deprivation, I emerged from the cave. The sun had only just risen above the towering mountain peaks, but shone so brightly between the gaps of grey cloud that swarmed overhead I was nearly blinded. Its rays streamed off every flake of glossy white snow, snow that coated everything in sight; from giant boulders jutting from the canyon walls, to the trees that lined the deep valley sprawling away over both of my shoulders.

We’d found our hideaway halfway up the side of the valley the night before. As night fell, a lucky break in the barrage of snow meant the dark rocky archway caught my eye, a striking contrast against the white world that surrounded it. In a rush of cries, blood and panic, we’d scrambled inside. There was no sign of that now. No sign of the frantic night before. The snow made everything so elegant; so calm; so clean. I had no idea where I was going now. I had no idea what I was going to do. The man that lay dead inside the cave was the smart one; my problem solver. The man that lay dead somewhere in the snow before me was my navigator; the one who could tell me where to go. I was just the muscle. The farmhand with a large sword and the will to swing it.

And I was alone.

My father had always warned me about coming into the mountains. There were two truths in life, he used to say: That the mountains were no place for farm folk, and that Uncle Ryle was a no good swindler. I’d learnt as a boy that my Uncle was not a swindler, he was just better at business. But many years later, I was finally learning my father wasn’t wrong about everything. But I had a purpose for being here; we all had a purpose. And we knew there were risks.

There was nothing left for me now. Nothing left but to finish what we started. I dug my boots into the snow beneath and trudged on. Where I was travelling — east, north, west, I had no idea — but I knew what I was looking for. I knew what I was hunting. Wraiths left behind a sort of luminous mist wherever they moved, like the shimmering trail of a slug. This was how we knew what had slaughtered the people of the village. This is how I knew what had killed my father. Often the trails meant it was easy to avoid the wraiths, but I wasn’t looking to avoid this one.

We’d found it already, or I should say, it had found us. Its bright frosty-blue eyes had emerged from in the encircling blizzard last night, appearing as if from nowhere out of the gloom. I immediately took a swing and missed, but it didn’t. It took out my navigator with a slash off its left claw, falling away into the blizzard, lost in the night forever. In the same movement, the beast carved up my companion with the right claw. There was no chance to defend ourselves, no chance to fight after that. We just had to run. It had now taken everyone from me. The last survivors. My family, my home. I couldn’t even go back to the farm, not really. Growing food on the frozen plains that lay in the shadow of these hellish mountains was damn-near impossible. Getting the conditions right in the frigid temperatures, where ice never left the ground, took a lifetime of experience and my father had not yet managed to teach me all I needed to know. Twenty-two years apparently was still not enough to be a farmer in a world ruled by frost. All I had now was my goal, our goal. To kill the beast that stole my future.

We weren’t even sure why it was in the village. Not in my lifetime, nor my father’s, nor his father’s before him, had a wraith left the mountains. He used to tell me all about them, as the hearth crackled away. The stories had grown even longer of late, with the new mining going on in the mountains. They brought to the village some new stone fuel, and with it, the fire burned longer than ever — which meant the stories just kept on going. Stories of monstrous creatures in the mountains. Bloodthirsty demons of an old world. My father would regale me with tales of wraiths cutting down weary travellers and seasoned knights alike. He himself had never seen one, nor had anyone I knew, but we all knew what they were. The stories were as old as time. The miner’s work got me asking even more questions about my father’s rules, though. Why were they allowed into the mountains if they were so dangerous? Apparently, a combination of military convoys and fire-wielding sorceresses kept them safe from both the elements and the wraiths. I was a bit disgruntled with the notion that I was so incapable when they were not. Those feelings had long since passed.

I wandered through the frost-touched valley for what seemed like an eternity. The land was beautiful, but baron. There was no food, no warmth, and no life, save the snow-laden pine trees that reached on for miles. I was feeling weaker and weaker by the minute. I had lost our supplies in the rush the previous night. The pack of food was now buried under inches of snow. I knew I’d never find it. I didn’t bother to search. Between dazzling brightness and dreary gloom, depending on how covered by clouds the sun was, I started to feel my resolve wain. I wanted to quit, to give up and leave this glorious, deadly place behind. But I couldn’t. I thought of the mangled bodies of my family. The guilt was overwhelming. Had I been there, not out in the city chasing women, I might have been able to fend off the beast.

The village wasn’t home to many able young men, only three, and none had been around when it came. Then I thought of my companion in the cave, the frost surely still biting at his quickly freezing corpse. The guilt was worse still. As they wept over their families, my heart filled with rage. I felt the anger wash over me, masking the pain — I knew that now, as the cold bit at my own heart and began to thaw the fiery anger that burned inside. I had to almost drag our navigator into the mountains, and now he lay dead within them. My companion was only slightly more willing. The wraith took both his wife and daughter, but even he wouldn’t have set foot on these treacherous slopes if I hadn’t driven him to it. I goaded him, playing off his torment. I had to kill the beast, it was the only way to unburden my guilty conscience.

Was the wraith that attacked us last night the same that cut down the villagers? It was impossible to say. They all looked identical, apparently. We didn’t know exactly how many were living in the mountains, but we did know was they were mindless killers and even if I slew the wrong one, I’d redeem myself by culling a true vision of evil. Wraiths were ancient creatures, powered only by a lust for death. I was always told that they didn’t consume the flesh of their prey, they took the very life from them and fed off that instead. I didn’t believe it, and I was still not sure. Except for the massive slashes across his torso where the wraith had cleaved him as he worked in the fields, my Father looked as he ever did when I found him. I expected the draining of life to look more dramatic, but maybe it wasn’t something you could see.

I continued to struggle on through the wilderness, my feet sliding into inches of fresh snow with every step. My pace was slow and staggering. I had no direction in my mind, just eyes peeled for the sight of that luminous foggy trail. Bitter breezes sailed through the trees constantly, hitting me from all angles. Beneath my thick furs, I was covered in leather padding wrapped in yet more furs. Beneath that were tight linens tucked into my boots and gloves. I was used to the freezing temperatures and knew how to keep them out, but in the mountains, where winds gathered speed as they whipped through the deep valleys, even I was succumbing to the pain of the cold. The steel greatsword, heavy on my back, was not helping either.

Nothing much changed all day, other than that I progressively shrank into myself, residing to the fact that I would simply wander these frozen wastes until I collapsed and died; dead wraith or not. I wasn’t even sure I’d be able to fight the monster alone when I was fit and healthy, not least now when I was ragged, tired, cold, weak and hungry. But what else could I do? I didn’t know my way out the mountains, even if I was coward enough to run. And yes, I’d thought about it. But then, things changed. It began with a bang. A horrible, low rumble that emanated from far away in the mountains, shaking the very ground around me and knocking snow from the branches overhead.

It lasted only a second, but was like nothing I’d ever heard before. Then, on the far side of the ravine, through the wiry trees, I saw cracks emerge in the snow, like splits in an ice-bound lake struck with a pick-axe. With a groan, the snow started to slide, slowly at first, but quickly picking up pace. It was crashing towards the deepest part of the valley — exactly where I stood. Heaving my stiff legs through the dense snow, I ambled frantically towards the other side of the valley, fear driving my frozen body to move faster than it should. I went up higher and higher until I could go no further; blocked by steep rock walls. Looking back, I saw snow swarm where I once stood, burying the land deep enough to cover me several times over. The force of the drift had brought down trees and uncovered a great expanse of bare rock on the cliffs of the valley’s far side.

Whatever had just happened transformed the landscape. It was as if I was standing in a totally different place. But that was not what interested me most. Down in the pit of the valley, where the freshly moved snow now lay, I could see something moving. Ducking behind a tree, I peered around to watch.

A lone wraith was moving around frantically in the canyon below, similar to a fly trapped in a jar. It was slashing wildly, dashing from tree-to-tree, cutting through them with ease. It was hard to make out its features, so far away was it, but it was definitely a wraith. About the size of a man and floating a foot or so above the ground, it left glowing trails of frosty-blue dust in its wake. After a moment of what seemed to be sheer panic, it let out a shriek, a piercing almost metallic noise, before darting away, dragging its low slung claws through the dusty, unsettled snow. With haste, I followed, just fast enough to outrun the dispersal of its trail. Walking through the mist was like walking through the heart of winter itself. The air was so cold it dragged deep into my lungs and felt like every breath was scaring them. I could feel ice forming on the hairs above my lip. I took to a path beside the wraith’s trail, I wouldn’t last long within it, and I was already on my last legs as it was.

Pushing forward took every scrap of energy I had, but I knew this would be my only chance. The wraith had moved far, its path leading me out of the sprawling valley and to the shores of a great frozen lake that stood between three looming mountain peaks. The frantic trail had slowly become calmer. The darting from side-to-side had stopped as the beast’s focus seemed to have narrowed. The trails were also thicker and more densely packed, spun with more and more floating specks of shimmering blue dust. I think it had slowed down.

I found it, seemingly rummaging through a bush of succulent red berries on the edge of the expansive lake. If I was to fight it, I was to fight it now, before I lost a single ounce more of my strength. The fires of revenge lit in my heart again at the sight of the wraith, they would keep me moving — even if the cold was trying hard to turn my bones to ice. My desire to slay the beast was all my mind’s eye was fixated on; that, and getting to the juicy berries on the bush behind it. We farmed these berries all the time. They grew on the slopes of the mountains just outside the village in abundance, although most were unreachable up the side of great, snow-covered clefts. They were delicious and hearty. They’d keep me going a little longer. With my heart pounding and my palms sweating despite the bitter, bitter cold, I drew my sword with a clatter of steel.

The wraith spun around in a smooth, gliding motion, its glowing blue eyes immediately found me. They were empty, soulless; without any humanity or emotion. They just glowed a hollow glow. Its eyes were set inside a narrow, elongated and pointed skull, grey and bare. A skull more like an ox’s than a man’s. From the skull grew a spine, of large bones as big as a fist that slowly trailed off into smaller pieces, until one, pointed bone hung about a foot from a ground. Just below its head, two arms sprang seemingly from nowhere. Attached not to shoulder blades nor its spine. To the arms were fixed giant claws, each longer than my forearms, thin, curved and sharp. There was no muscle, flesh or skin on the wraith. Nothing holding its bones together but a thick fog of glowing blue dust that clung to its form. Legend has it that a stroke of a sword through the spine would severe the magic that bound this ancient monster together, and the wraith would simply crumble.

I was about to find out if that were true.

As it approached, the beast’s gaze bore into me. It moved slowly, seemingly cautious. Stopping and starting, edging closer. I gripped my sword with both hands, raised it as steady as I could and prepared to swing. But about ten feet away, the wraith stopped. It let out a hollow snort. Again, the noise was metallic, an unusual sound for a living creature to make. To my surprise, it didn’t charge, leap or race towards me, slashing its talons. The wraith simply turned and started to glide away. Ignoring my presence, my stance, my willingness to fight. It was just leaving. I was frozen, not by the cold, but by disbelief. Where was it going? Why wasn’t it trying to tear me apart? My confusion turned to anger. Did it think it could just kill my father and get away with it? Did it think I would just let it float away?

“No!’ I screamed, my voice echoing across expanse before me.

It didn’t even turn around. It just kept moving towards another patch of berries nearby. I’d had enough. I started to run. The snow thinned by the lake’s edge, allowing swifter movement. I held my sword high. I was going to kill it. I was going to take my revenge. One slice, across its back. It was too easy. But I was going to do it. For my Father. For my companions. For th…

My foot caught the lip of a concealed rock beneath the snow and I tumbled forward, sword flung from my hands. I landed face down in the snow, and my strength evaporated in that moment. My body was so battered, so achy, so cold that it hurt. I couldn’t bring myself to rise. I could just lay here and die. I steeled what little resolve I had and rolled over to face the sky. Above me I saw blue, but I wasn’t the soft blue of a clear sky. It was darker, and shimmered in the sunlight. The wraith was above me, its long, gangly, claw-ridden arms either side of my head. It gazed down, arching its spine, peering at me. I prepared myself for the end.

Yet again, the wraith shocked me.

After a moment of curiosity, it moved on, far more interested in the berries than me. Hauling myself to my feet, I grasped at my sword on the ground beside me, dug it into the ice and used it to prop myself up as I stood panting, watching the ancient being. I didn’t understand. The wraith leaned over the bush, using its claws to cut away thicker branches and dead foliage. Taking a long, jagged breath, it made a sound like howling wind blasting through a cave. How it breathed without lungs I’ll never know, but it seemed to do so all the same. The bush rustled as the wraith inhaled, and began to wither, the berries turning from a cherry-red to mouldy black. Their plump and juicy shape sagging and oozing. The wraith moved on to yet another bush. There were plenty in this exposed part of the mountains.

The scene unfolding before me was nothing like what I expected a wraith encounter to be like. It was… peaceful. The fires of my rage, my desire for revenge, were all but extinguished. Instead, I felt the cold creeping up inside my body, taking every inch of me. My breath was slow and shallow and I could no longer feel my heart beating in my neck. I wondered if it was beating at all. What drove me no longer did, but now I had no reason to go on. I could no longer feel my legs, my hands gripping my sword, or anything else for that matter. I just felt the ice. Ice in my veins, ice in my heart. I caught one final glimpse of the wraith, draining the life from another patch of berries, before my hand slipped from the hilt and I felt the snow envelop me. What followed was a haze. I could feel myself moving, snow rushing over my shoulders, down my back and into the crevices of my boots. I was being dragged. My eyelids were heavy and frozen shut, but I could see light flickering beyond them.

Then, darkness.

I was no longer being dragged through snow, I was on a much rougher surface. I tore my eyes open and cast a look around. I found myself in yet another cave, now propped up against the wall, just as my companion had been. The navigator crouch over me, grinning. He reached beneath his shredded fur cloak — it was slung over his shoulders haphazardly, its proper form destroyed by large gashes all across it — and pulled out a handful of berries. He pushed them towards me. I took them without a thought, without even a thank you.

“I thought you were dead” I croaked, after scoffing down the sweet berries.

“I thought you were dead” The navigator replied, nodding to the tracks that lay outside the cave; the marks of my body that he’d dragged through the glistening snow.

“I slew the monster”.

“What?”

“The beast was just there, looking at a bush. It didn’t even notice me sneak up. I took your sword and cut it in half. The stories are true, you know? One swing was all it took.”

When would I stop feeling it? This all-consuming guilt. Sadness overcame me, the mourning feelings I should have had for my Father, instead of the unbridled anger. The anger that had cost too many too much. The navigator could see the look on my face, the look of regret, sorrow and devastation, not the joy and retribution he’d been seeking. I didn’t feel anything I thought I’d feel. I just felt more pain.

Pain for another life lost for no reason. <|endoftext|>

What in the world does a millionaire, real estate Millennial of 
New York City have to do with an ancient superstition from the 
Middle East?  And why is that ancient tale intruding on Trevor 
Mesa’s life and one of his long-time tenants?
New York City; Manhattan.  USA.  Present Day…
“…Yes, ma’am…Ye— Yes, ma’am…Ok, I’ll—ma’am, I’ll be over 
as soon as I can…Yes, it’ll be by subway…Ok, I’ll hurry,” Trevor 
said; finally hanging up his smartphone.  He let out a 
discouraged sigh.  “Christ…”  
He had just gotten his falafel-bowl and sat down on a bench 
when one of his long-time tenants had called about a situation 
with her apartment in Harlem.  He was one of New York City’s 
up-and-coming realtors, but Trevor still worked another gig on 
the side by renting several apartments throughout the borough. 
He stuffed the olive oil-laden falafel in his mouth with his plastic 
spoon after gathering his laptop-satchel and Styrofoamed-latte. 
Trevor then made sure his hipster-beard had no crumbs on it 
with a couple of quick strokes with his hands—almost as a dairy 
farmer did with his or her hands while milking a cow!  He then 
headed straight for the nearest subway entry…
nd
132  Street; Harlem.  Anam Shehez’s residence…
Trevor finally made it to his small complex of apartments in 
Harlem that he rented out.  It wasn’t the largest property in the 
neighborhood, but it was one of the most updated complex on 
the block.  He was supposed to be showing a very wealthy, 
potentially new client a loft that Trevor had just renovated 
months ago.  He was relieved that the social media magnate was 
flexible enough to push the show-date to another day.  Trevor 
was one of those Millennials with not only his head on straight, 
but so was his heart.  He had just turned 30 a few months ago, 
and was already a multi-millionaire with his own real estate 
business!  
But to Anam Shehez, she just needed him to be a good landlord 
right now…
“Mrs. Shehez,” Trevor said to her as he reached her location; 
several yards away from the apartments, “may I ask why you’re 
out here?  Was there someone in the apartment after all?”  It was 
approaching dusk and there were several people hustling their 
way to home or the bars after work.
All she did for a while was shake her head repeatedly.  She kept 
her head down before responding.  “Mr. Mesa, I don’t 
understand why a rich man like you won’t get a car!  You could 
have gotten here sooner!”
“Not with New York’s traffic, Mrs. Shehez.  And especially this 
time of day…so, what’s going on?”
Now she looked back, toward the complex; her traditional 
Pakistani dress and trousers colorful in comparison to their 
surroundings.  Trevor looked on with her, but he couldn’t see 
anything worth catching the widow’s attention.  Again, she 
started shaking her head.  “I thought it was him, Mr. Mesa…”
His head went back and forth between the elderly Pakistani and 
the three-storied apartments.  “You mean Mr. Shehez?  Mrs. 
Shehez, I’m sorry but your husband passed away four years 
ago.”
“Yes, I know…I just thought maybe…”  She sighed.  But her head 
never actually stopped shaking.  “Something is not right, Mr. 
Mesa…there is something in there that has the presence of 
Abdel, but clearly is not!”
Trevor took in a deep breath and slowly exhaled.  He looked 
around the neighborhood at all the busy New Yorkers and a few 
tourists.  Mrs. Shehez was almost like an aunt to him.  He knew 
she was very superstitious, but he did not want to come across as 
condescending.  
“I take it calling the cops would’ve been a waste of time,” he 
said; more of a statement than a question.
“Usually they’ll tell you there would have to be something more 
threatening before they send someone over.  Besides, this is 
outside of their expertise…I recorded it with my phone.  Did you 
want to see it?”
Trevor looked at her with surprise.  That should’ve been the first 
thing she showed him before their conversation!  Again, Trevor 
was willing to work with her.  He took a step over to where she 
stood and took her smartphone as she offered it to him.  
Trevor had to take the phone off rest-default before he played 
the short video.  Indeed, in the shot—taken in Mrs. Shehez’s 
small living room—appeared to show a ghostly, moving image of 
some being slowly walking; just passing the wall that led to her 
short hallway, and the apparition was gone!  The recorded video 
footage then began to jostle as Mrs. Shehez quickly walked to the 
area of the hallway where the being was spotted.  The footage 
then showed that she turned around the corner from the living 
room that led to that same hall, and there was a flash…not of 
light, but of some unexpected form that enveloped the video’s 
field of vision!  
But there were no breaks in Mrs. Shehez’s recording.  In the 
video, one could hear her yelp as the dark-flash popped right in 
front of her!  Next was the empty hallway; as its image jerked 
back and forth in the recording while Mrs. Shehez is heard 
crying in the background…then the video ended.
Trevor’s eyes had cut over to Mrs. Shehez; the rest of his body 
unmoving.  She merely looked at the young realtor.  The first 
thing that came to his mind was, whatever it was he saw in the 
video, how was it that it seemed to pass right through her or 
passed her, yet she showed no signs of any injury.  Which, on its 
face, was good news.  
However…
“Mrs. Shehez,” Trevor said after a moment’s thought, “would 
you mind if I were to share this footage with a friend of mine 
who’s well-versed and practiced in…”
“Ghosts?”
He looked at her.  There was a bit of askance to her and Trevor 
felt some pity for the octogenarian.  “I was going to say the 
Paranormal…her name is Jenny.  She’s traveled all over the 
world for studies of the Paranormal and I think she’s just the 
person for this.”
Mrs. Shehez merely nodded; tears beginning to well up in her 
eyes.  She watched as the young man, very deftly, typed a long 
series of commands into her smartphone and then Trevor 
handed the phone back to Mrs. Shehez.  She looked at her 
phone, then back at the young millionaire with strained brows.
“Well, don’t you need my phone to share the recording with 
your friend?”
Trevor, at first, froze.  He had to remind himself that most 
people in their sixties—much less their eighties!—simply don’t 
use social media!  He began to laugh hardily.
“Mrs. Shehez, it’s all done electronically.”
“Oh…I believe I actually understand that, now!”
They both went silent.  Both surveyed the neighborhood as night 
began to darken the sky.  Streetlights were now automatically 
switching on.
“Mrs. Shehez, do you have a relative or friend that you can spend 
the night with tonight?”
She thought for a moment.  She nodded her head.  “One of my 
sons…I did not want to be a bother…he has his own family.  I 
can’t see going back in there, Mr. Mesa!”
“You don’t have to tell me, Mrs. Shehez!  I’m sure your son will 
be more than glad to have you stay over.  Should we call him?”
Mrs. Shehez placed the call to her son.  It was all in Urdu.  After 
she finished her conversation with him—which, of course, 
included the situation she found herself in—she replaced her 
phone back into her pocket and gave a thin smile to Trevor.
They decided to walk over to a nearby diner to wait for her son. 
Trevor bought dinner for Mrs. Shehez and himself.  It would be 
about forty-five minutes before the middle-aged man drove up 
in a nice car—one of those old school, big American luxury 
vehicles.  He got out and met Trevor and his mother outside of 
the diner.  He shook Trevor’s hand and thanked him for taking 
care of his mother, especially since his father had died.  
Fazal Shehez, in simple jeans and a sweatshirt—most likely he 
threw them on in a hurry—insisted that he drive the multi-
millionaire Millennial to his home in the Chelsea area.  But 
Trevor wanted to stay and go into Mrs. Shehez’s apartment and 
check out the situation for himself.  He always carried all his 
properties’ keys with him.  New York City was simply too dense 
to have to turn around and go back home just for a key!
By the time the Shehezs had left for Fazal’s home it was dark 
outside.  Trevor made his way to Mrs. Shehez’s apartment…
When Trevor opened Anam Shehez’s apartment door, the aroma 
of curry wafted passed him.  Tomorrow, he thought to himself, 
he would make it a point to have lunch from any of the 
international restaurants that made curry! 
The apartment was modest and relatively bare; predominately 
styled in the traditions of Pakistan.  Mrs. Shehez was in such a 
hurry she left her flat screen tv on.  To be able to listen for 
anything out of the ordinary, Trevor turned it off with the 
remote.  The stark silence after the flat screen went off was 
almost troubling itself, even with the apartment’s lights on!
Remembering Mrs. Shehez’s recorded video, Trevor took out his 
own smartphone and began recording his inspection.  Later, he 
thought, he would share the video with his Paranormal friend, 
Jenny Housman.  She lived out in Westbrook, Maine; one of the 
suburbs of Portland, Maine.  She had moved there with her 
husband and their two daughters from New York City after her 
husband had gotten a good job offer from a call center firm. 
They were the best of friends since middle school.  Indeed, 
sometimes Trevor wondered if that friendship between the two 
was the real reason why Jenny’s husband sought a job far out 
from New York.  But close enough for the family to travel back to 
the city to see relatives and friends…
Twenty minutes later Trevor had completely inspected Mrs. 
Shehez’s apartment for anything suspicious.  He simply could 
not find anything outside the Normal.  He began to wonder if the 
elderly woman was beginning to suffer from Munchausen. 
Again, it had been four years since her husband’s death…
“Whoa!” he yelped!  It was a call from Jenny.  Her thumbnail-
sized pictured avatar was lit up with all the contact info on 
Trevor’s smartphone!
“Woman, you have impeccable t—“
“Where are you?”
Trevor froze.  “I’m at Mrs. Shehez’s apartment…She went to stay 
over at—“
“Good,” Jenny’s curt, high-pitched voice punctured.  “Now you 
get the hell out of there, Trev…now!”
Of course, he was going to ask why, but he knew that Jenny 
would just insist even harsher.  More to the point, he trusted 
Jenny and knew there had to be a very good reason for her 
demeanor.  
So, Trevor ran straight out of the apartment!  He had the 
presence of mind to lock the front door before slamming it shut 
behind him as he virtually flew out of Mrs. Shehez’s apartment! 
A couple of his other tenants saw him nearly crash into the wall 
opposite of the apartment’s front door in the apartment’s 
hallway!  They both started toward him, but Trevor waved them 
off, graciously.  He lied to them about tripping over one of Mrs. 
Shehez’s rugs as he was walking out of the apartment, after 
doing a welfare check-up on her.  That did the trick, and Trevor 
calmly left the complex and began walking toward the subway 
area.
He called Jenny back.
“Where are you now,” she asked once again.
“I’m heading toward the subway—“
“Please don’t…I’m heading out there, now.  I’m driving out to 
Portland’s airport as we speak, Trev.”
Trevor flinched.  “Jenny, what the hell is going on?  What’s 
spooked you so bad?” 
“I’ll explain when I’m there with you.  I don’t want to talk on a 
plane about the craft, you know what I’m sayin’?”
Her ways of putting things made Trevor laugh.  It was one of the 
things he adored so much about her.
“Ok, an hour and a half is not such a bad wait.”
“And, Trev?”
He had decided to go back to the all-hours diner he and Mrs. 
Shehez had eaten earlier to wait for Jenny.  “Yeah?”
“You really should get you a car, you filthy rich man!”
Two Hours Later, at the dinner…
Trevor and Jenny had done all the hugging and joking that two 
good friends do when they haven’t seen each other for months. 
They had ordered coffee and waited until the server walked away 
before they got to business.
Jenny had brought only a portion of her Paranormal equipment 
with her on her flight from Portland, Maine.  One of the tools 
was an electronic tablet that she adapted for her researches in 
the Paranormal.  She slid it toward Trevor for him to take a 
look…
It took a while, but Trevor realized what he was looking at.  “This 
is from part of Mrs. Shehez’s video that I sent you during the 
day!”
“Yup…”  Jenny, a couple of years older than Trevor; also wearing 
thick-rimmed glasses, gestured with a jutting chin for him to 
inspect the still-image further.
The server showed up again, this time with their coffee, cream, 
and water.  Trevor went ahead and paid and tipped the young 
woman and continued to stare at the image on the etablet.
“What the hell is that,” he finally said, giving up.
She reached over the table of cups of coffee and water and began 
to tap in some commands.  Jenny leaned back in her seat with 
satisfaction.  The video from Mrs. Shehez was, once again, 
playing, but with several filters added:  for dark and light 
contrasts, for shadow-reductions, some sharpening of outlines…
All those filters helped sharpen, though not perfectly, the image 
of that dark-flash toward the end of Mrs. Shehez’s video.  Jenny 
had also set the etablet to loop that flash-point of the video.  
The being, very dark-brown with dark mustard-orange sclerae 
for its eyes, could be seen leaping in front of the Mrs. Shehez’s 
phone-camera.  If, in fact, that was what it was doing.  Again, the 
quality of the footage was a bit grainy, but it was the best that 
Jenny could do with, apparently, footage taken from a 
Paranormal encounter!  The being seemed humanoid in 
appearance, but clearly it was not of the sapiens lineage!  Indeed, 
from some of the details of the recording of the being’s 
surroundings—Mrs. Shehez’s hallway—the being looked a lot 
larger than most humans!  It had a shock of hair; its arms held 
out, as if it were almost beckoning someone!
Without even having to say a word, all Trevor did was slowly 
raise his eyes from the electronic tablet and put them on Jenny. 
She obliged.
“ ‘I Dream Of Jeannie’… ‘Aladdin’…you know, the ol’ rubbing 
the ancient oil lamp and what we call today a genie smokes out 
and grants you wishes…that, my friend, is a bona fide djinni.”
By that time, Trevor was nodding while watching the looping 
video on the etablet.  “With a ‘d.’  Yeah, I read about that in art 
history…aren’t they from the mysticism of the Sufi sect of 
Islam?”
“Well, djinn are mentioned in the Quran, and the Sufi are usually 
more associated with the concept of the djinn.  But it’s kind of a 
regional thing in the Middle East going back far more than three 
thousand years before Islam was even founded!  Kind of like 
paganism with the Europeans before they took to Christianity, 
right?  Mind you, other parts of the Middle East farther away 
from ancient Mesopotamia had their own spin on the djinn…”
Jenny leaned forward in her seat at the diner-table and did some 
swiping on the electronic tablet to bring up another window 
from another website that she, apparently, had saved on her 
tablet.  The image brought up was of ancient Mesopotamia, but 
the rendering looked very similar with early- Medieval European 
Christian paintings!  Instead of Roman lettering, Arabic 
calligraphy adorned the ancient page which the artwork was 
painted on.  To the right within the scene, loomed a large, dark 
caricature of a djinni holding a male human that was mostly 
naked.  To the left of this djinni were other mythical beings—one 
with wings and a set of horns atop its head as it appeared to be 
flying down from the heavens while two more beings were 
planted on the earth.  Each of those creatures actually looked 
more animal-like and distorted than the giant djinni depicted in 
the ancient painting!  
The one thing that stuck out most to Trevor was how the smaller 
beings facing the seated giant holding the human all had their 
hands out toward the djinni—as if in a pleading or beckoning 
gesture.  Very similar how the djinni was holding his hands out 
in that dark-flashing moment from Mrs. Shehez’s recorded 
video!
Trevor hovered a pointing finger at this observation; careful not 
to touch the interactive monitor.  “Right here…what are these 
other creatures doing, Jen?  It’s almost as if they’re trying to coax 
the djinni into giving the human to them!”
Jenny looked at Trevor with a smile that he recognized.  He was 
on to something, but she wanted Trevor to figure it out for 
himself!  He looked at Jenny’s guiding smile, then back at the 
ancient parchment on the etablet.  He thought for a while…
“This is an ancient tale from the Middle East…Mrs. Shehez and 
her husband are from Pakistan—a bit on the eastern edge from 
Mesopotamia, but a lot of shared cultural themes…that’s got to 
be a connection!  And—and in this ancient scene, it’s almost as if 
the djinni is trying to protect the human!  If not, then…”
“Why wasn’t Mrs. Shehez hurt in the encounter, Trev,” Jenny 
asked with some sympathy.
Again, Trevor thought for a while as his eyes went to his cooled 
cup of coffee; trying to dig deeper into the weird world of the 
Paranormal that was more suited for Jenny and not him!  “I was 
wondering about that myself…”  Then, Trevor flinched!  His 
head snapped from the table and his eyes peered at Jenny. 
“There were two apparitions recorded!  I—I had forgotten with 
all the…the first one was slow-moving, like how an elderly man 
might walk—”
“Yes,” Jenny responded; but her smile was gone from her face.
“Mrs. Shehez turned the corner while chasing the first 
apparition, and…and that’s when that flash happened—the 
djinni jumped right in front of Mrs. Shehez…”
Both sat silently; staring at each other.  Jenny already knew the 
answer, but Trevor was not far behind.  It was something he 
didn’t like the answer to, but the logic behind the whole 
incident, the ancient history, and the Paranormal expert’s 
guiding hand all seemed to converge at that point!
“A refill for either of you,” the young server had asked; an old-
fashioned glass coffee pot in hand.  She seemed to catch on that 
the conversation at the table was on the heavy side.
“I’ll take some more, thank you,” Jenny said with a bright smile 
that beguiled the mood at the diner-table.
“I’m good, thanks,” Trevor said absent-mindedly as he 
continued to look at that painting of a tale from antiquities.  He 
reached into his jacket-pocket and produced his smartphone. 
With a couple of swipes, Trevor had made a call.  
“Yeah, hello, is this Fazal Shehez; Mrs. Shehez’s son?  Ok, good. 
Look, I was calling to—.  When…?  Oh my god…heart attack?” 
He looked at Jenny, but she kept drinking her cup of coffee while 
she looked out the window of the diner; a knowing-look on her 
face.  “Yeah, my condolences, Mr. Shehez…Yeah, I’ll get in touch 
with you later about her things…No problem, Mr. Shehez; that’s 
what a good landlord is supposed to do…”

 <|startoftext|> Wolfy Things
by Erin Roberts
 

Tonight, me and Lee gonna kill the wolf. Been digging a pit out in the woods all summer, filling it up with wolfsbane and sharp rocks big as our heads, covering it up with leaves so wolfy eyes can’t tell it’s there. Lee even snatched a whole chicken outta his Pa’s coop, snapped its neck and threw it on the pile like some kinda wolf Christmas come early. Wolf just has to go sniffing over by the edge and we give a good push and we’ll be Nicky and Lee, honest-to-God wolf-killers.

Lee says they still gonna be talking ‘bout us when our grandkids is old and crook-backed, just like they do Old Cooper Lyons. Coop’s mean as a snake in a wood pile, but ever since he tricked that whole pack into calling truce and then burned ‘em to the ground, cubs and all, they ‘bout throw him a parade whenever he comes through town. So by sunup, ain’t nobody gonna care why I ain’t got no Daddy or where Lee’s Ma went off to or how I got my devil eyes. And once that damn wolf’s good and dead, he won’t be coming ‘round my house no more.

First time I seen the wolf was two years past, day I turned ten. Old enough to handle a knife and stand watch like Lee done for his Pa three years already. Wasn’t really nothing to see out there but the same old trees and stars and Lee’s Pa’s cabin down the way, but better’n watching Ma sniffle and drip tears all over the floor like a leaky roof. She been like that since forever, river in her eyes and stone in her throat, always gulping out things ‘bout vows and sins and being sorry, and ain’t a man alive what wants to watch his own Ma cry.

I woke mid-watch, leaned up against the side of the cabin, knife on the ground and wolf in my face, its goldy eyes flashing like fireflies. Froze me up faster than a tongue on ice—barely got my legs squeezed together tight enough not to piss the ground. Lee always says a wolf’ll kill you right off soon as it sees you, add you to its coat of little boy skins. But this one just stood there tall on hind legs, hairy and naked as a hound-dog, smelling like new-killed hogs and dirt and bare feet after running. Then it honest-to-God started talking, real words and everything, voice deep as far-off thunder.

“Your Ma know you’re out here?”

Hearing it talk about Ma unfroze me right quick. Man can’t let no beast come for his kin. I reached for the knife, but the wolf grabbed hold of my wrist and laughed. I tried turning this way and that, but it didn’t make no difference. Its palms was spongy-soft, but they clamped down tight as a bear trap all the same.

“Let go!”  I said, voice coming out high and squeaky.

“So you can grab your knife and gut me?”

“Do what I have to,” I said, growling in my throat to get my voice deep. “Protect my kin.”


“Can’t protect nothing with your eyes closed.”

“They open now,” I said, puffing my chest up big like I seen birds do. Ain’t matter if it had me by the wrist or the throat. Can’t show no beast you’re weak.

“Keep ‘em that way,” wolf said. “Dangerous out here at night.”

“I ain’t scared of you.”

“Good,” it said, dropping my wrist and flashing fangs, like the devil tryin’ to smile.

I swung out, hard, but my arms wasn’t long enough to reach and all the wolf did was laugh again, low and quiet under that fangy smile.

“Be sure and tell your Ma I came by.”

“You leave her alone!”

Wolf laughed harder this time, loud and long and wild. Felt the sound rippling all the way in my toes.

“You ask her about that one.”

‘Fore I could do nothing more, the wolf fell back into the night, melted away like snow in spring. I ran inside fast as I could and woke Ma, but telling her just got her asking how he looked and checking out the window and giggling and then crying again, harder than ever. Swore right then I’d kill that thing one day. Don’t like nothing messing with my Ma.

Wolf ain’t show his face again for a full year. Not ‘til the night I turned eleven. Ma throwed me a party for my birthday—just the two of us, but she wore her yellow Sunday dress and fixed wildberry pie and made me wash my feet and everything. She was in one of her sunshine moods all day, humming some song I don’t know, touching her hair all the time like bugs had got in it or something. Even caught her looking out the window once or twice.

“Don’t worry ‘bout that wolf, Ma,” I said. “Probably ain’t coming back noways.”

“Course not,” Ma said, voice shaky. I moved the pie so she wouldn’t salt it none if she started crying. “Lucky I got you, baby. Real lucky. We ain’t meant to travel this life alone.”

“Don’t you worry,” I said. “I ain’t gonna let him hurt you.” That got her smiling a little bit.

“My brave boy,” she said. “Must be all that sunshine in your eyes.” She’s always saying that. Lee says they look like hellfire damnation, but he ain’t never stayed awake for a full sermon on Sunday, so he don’t know heaven from hell really.

“You go on now,” Ma said. “Bring in some wood from the shed. And if you see that wolf lurking ‘round, you just let him know how brave you are.” That was gonna be easy. Ain’t nothing braver than doing some killing.

Wolf was there soon as I got to the woodshed, all dressed up like a man, tall and dark haired and wearing some old sheet like it was a shirt, but eyes on fire and the smell of blood and mud and river.

“So you’re still playing killer,” he said.

“Don’t know what you mean,” I said, faking an itch and hiding my knife behind my back. This time I was ready. Lee told me all ‘bout how just a plain hunting knife can’t hurt no wolf, how you gotta dip it in crushed up wolfsbane first. I hated picking them flowers, all purple and girly and smelling like death, making my hands feel like fire ants had crawled on ‘em. But least this time wouldn’t nobody be laughing.

“Your Ma teach you to lie like that?”

“I ain’t lyin’!” Preacher’d say I was wrong for that. But then preacher’d say only good wolf is a dead wolf, so I figured it came up even.

“Trade you for the knife,” wolf said. “Call it a birthday present.”

“How you know my birthday? You been spyin’ on me?”

“Gimme that thing and I’ll tell you.”

Wolf smiled big and toothy, stuck out a hand full of wildberries. I hit out real fast with the knife, felt it hit skin ‘fore he could pull back. Half the berries went flying and half got crushed up, dripping purple off his hand like spilt Communion wine. He started to chuckling like before, but it turned howl halfway through and he clutched at his wrist, sagging against the shed.

“Wolfsbane?” His whole body shivered as he said it, hairs on his neck flicking back and forth and lines on his forehead pulling together, looking deep and dark as old man scars.

“Kills wolves,” I said.

“Kills men too,” wolf said. Then he brought his palm up to his face, started sucking the berries and the wolfsbane right off, spitting ’em out into the darkness. “Even kills little boys that ain’t quite either.”

“Hot damn!” Lee’s voice, ‘round the corner of the shed. Wolf crouched down soon as he heard it, whimpered as he put the scratched hand down on the ground. Could see his hairy neck still shaking, close enough to slash through, but the knife felt heavy in my hand for a second and then he was gone.

“Why you ain’t kill it?” Lee asked, pushing my back up against the shed. His voice sounded half-whisper half-shout.

“Ain’t have the chance. He ran off when he heard you. Told you not to keep creeping around here tryin’ to be the one to get him.”

“You blaming me? You the one let it get away! Knew I shoulda kept on you soon as you saw it last time—you ain’t man enough to take care of nothing!” Lee’s breath was all hot and his spit was landing on my face like rain and I grabbed the knife handle tight. Could kill a man as easy as a beast if I needed to. Wolf said so.

“Get off me! Got him with the wolfsbane like you said—what else you want?”

“Want it dead,” Lee said. “Want all them damn beasts dead. You want ‘em to poison the water or curse the wheat or take your Ma like they took mine?” I shook my head. ‘Course Missy Green said Lee’s Ma ran off with one of them Bible sellers, but no reason to tell Lee all that. Not when he was ‘bout ready to hit me.

Lee ain’t move for a while, just stood there close enough to share breath. I squeezed the knife so hard my fingers hurt, but he ain’t make a fist or nothing. Just stood there and sighed.

“We ain’t losing it again,” he said, “Next time, me and you gonna kill that thing proper. Like men do.”

“You gotta get it to come this way,” Lee says. He’s sitting on a rock by the edge of the pit, chewing on sourgrass and stomping ants. “But you two so friendly, probably just gotta pet it and ask it nice.”

“Told you it ain’t say nothing to me. Just begging not to kill it.” That ain’t quite right, but it’s all Lee needs to know.

“Heard what I heard,” Lee says, “Like how maybe your Ma—”

“Lay off!” I try to yell it, but I can hear my voice getting all tight and gaspy. Lee just laughs his mean laugh, loud and sharp like a shotgun firing.

“Fine,” he says. “But you get that thing to come this way tonight.”

“Said I’d get it here ten times already, didn’t I? Man’s only good as his word.”

Lee’s face twists ugly and he laughs a little more, under his breath where he don’t think I can hear.

“See ya tonight, Nicky,” he says. “And happy birthday.”

Ma don’t barely look up when I get home from the pit. She ain’t dressed for no party this year, and I don’t smell no pie. Just stares out the window mostly, sniffling and dripping, whispering to herself ‘bout shouldas and mights. Told her I killed the wolf last year, but it ain’t seem to make nothing better. She probably known I was lying. This time I’ma bring back something to prove that damn wolf’s dead. Then she ain’t gonna have nothing to cry about.

See the wolf pacing by the fence soon as I tiptoe out into the dark. Got on pants and a white cotton shirt. Even a little hat, like he’s some Godfearing man heading for prayers, but he still smells like mist and gritty porridge and old men’s breath, and eyes still look like baby fireballs.

I nod at him and start walking away from the farmlands and into the trees. Towards the pit, slow and steady, like I don’t have no kind of direction in mind.

“No knife this time?” he says, walking behind me.

“No knife,” I say, showing my hands. “Ain’t sorry I cut you, tho. Men kill wolves. Wolves kill men. How it is.”

He don’t say nothing back for a little. Just keeps on following, so I keep on walking, watchin’ the trees get taller and closer in ‘til it looks like the leaves is making shadows on the moon. Pit ain’t far now.

“Never killed a man, you know,” he says. “Wouldn’t know how.”

“Plenty of ways. Razor claws. Poison fangs. Wolfy things.”

He laughs, but this time it don’t sound as wild. “You seen any of those? Not enough wolf in me, maybe. Not much left in any of us.”

“Us?” The word gets big in my throat, tries to choke me from inside.

“The pack,” he says. “Could meet ‘em, if you want. Ain’t far.” He points over to the witchwood, where the trees stay bare and the fireflies glow blue and don’t nothing but evil make it through the night. I don’t say a thing. Feet feel stuck to the ground, like the dirt grew fingers and won’t let go.

“Don’t have to go,” he says. “Just thought you might wanna meet some other folks what got sunshine in their eyes. We ain’t meant to travel this life alone.”

He holds out his hand. Moon’s high enough that I can see the palm, gone grey in the middle where I cut him last time, like a chestnut tree rotting from the inside. Makes me think on what he’ll look like laying in the pit, if he’ll make that sound like the pigs do at slaughter, if his face will rot away into dust, if there won’t be nothing left to take home to Ma but that stupid little hat.

I reach out for his hand. Can always kill him in the morning.

“Damn beast!” Lee. “You stay the hell back. Ain’t taking nobody nowhere!”

Lee comes out the darkness fast. Can’t see nothing clear, but the moon glints off knife-metal behind a tree and I smell sweat and death and berries. Then Lee yells loud and close and angry and the wolf’s hand is still stuck out there, hanging half-dead in the air. I hear myself screaming and I reach out for the wolf, like that’s gonna make some kind of difference, but Lee’s too close and I’m too far and there ain’t nothing to do really but pray.

Something hits my arm hard enough to spin me round and I hear a crash, like a tree branch falling to the ground. Open the eyes I didn’t know I’d shut and Lee’s on the dirt, laying still, with the wolf peering over him. Lee ain’t never laid that still in his life.

“Kills men too,” says the wolf. His voice is a whisper, but his eyes are full fire.

“You killed him?” I think I should be yelling, but my voice comes out thin and wet.

“Damn fool boy tripped and cut his own self,” he says.

“Why’d you do that? You ain’t have to kill him.” I say it, but I can still feel it in my arm where Lee musta run into me, smell the copper-sweet of blood mixed with poison. Neither of us ever knew how to stay in our right place.

“Told you I ain’t ever killed nobody,” says the wolf. “But they ain’t gonna care. They gonna burn me and mine just the same, every one.” He turns his head to the witchwood, then back at me. “I gotta—“

“We can put him in the pit,” I say. “It’s a coyote trap me and…it’s a thing we was working on.” Wolf shakes his head. “Won’t nobody blame you if they don’t know you was here.”

Wolf takes a step away, almost trips over Lee’s feet. I ain’t been looking either, just pretending Lee’s a stone or a log or faking dead to keep the wolf off guard. Ain’t got time for thinking. Just doing. Lee’d like that.

Wolf stops trying to get untangled and bends in close by Lee’s face, just staring like he ain’t never seen nothing dead before. ‘Fore I can say one word more, he scoops up Lee’s body off the ground, throws him over a shoulder like a sack of flour.

“Show me,” he says.

Pit can’t be more than three stone’s throws off, but time goes slow as a molasses drip in winter and my feet feel heavy. Takes most of my mind just to keep moving straight ahead, not look over at Lee’s arms hanging down like he’s waiting for me to hand him something just outta reach.

“We still gotta head out tonight,” says the wolf.

“We?” I turn my head his way, almost trip over a branch.

“The pack,” he says. “Ain’t no telling what your people will do once they find the boy.”

“Lee,” I say, even though Lee probably wouldn’t want no wolf to know his Christian name. “And they ain’t gonna do nothing. It’s an accident, right?”

“Yeah. Maybe. But no sense waiting around to see.” Wolf goes quiet for a minute ‘fore he speaks again. “You just gonna have to meet them some other time,” he says. “Next birthday. Maybe.”

I don’t say nothing back. Just step and step and hear the sound of branches breaking and feel the leaves crunching under my feet and think on what I got to do.

First thing I see when we get there is the rock Lee was sitting on just this morning, chewing that damn grass and laughing at me. Pit’s right next to it, still looking just as innocent as you please, like a hole full of leaves just wet from the rain and a chicken like a cherry on top. Wolf looks jumpy, though, sniffing around. He ain’t never gonna get too close on his own.

“All you gotta do is put him right down in those leaves,” I say. “Plenty sharp rocks down there to look like they did the killing. You’ll see.”

Wolf stares my way for a second, then nods, steps careful over to the edge, leans over.

I only have to push a little.

Lee and the wolf fall together, hitting the rocks like a bad apple from a tree, wet and squishy. ‘Course Lee can’t notice, just lays as still as ever, but I wait for the wolf to howl. He don’t even whimper. Just coughs a little, whispers something ‘bout the sun that I ain’t listening to. Plenty wolfsbane in there—he ain’t gonna be doing much for long.

“Ma prolly gonna cheer up once she knows for sure you gone,” I say. “Gonna stop all that crying, start making wildberry pie again and everything.” Wolf don’t say nothing, but I hear panting still, so I know he hears me.

“And Lee’s Pa’s gonna be right proud he killed a wolf. Gonna be telling stories ‘bout that for a long time. Lee and Nicky, genuine to-the-bone wolf-killers.” Wolf don’t say nothing. Don’t even take a breath. Just smells like piss and death and dust.

I keep on talking, even if he can’t hear none of the rest—how the witchwood ain’t no more’n a half-day’s journey out and back. How they prolly gonna let me and Lee’s Pa carry the torches when we burn the whole pack to the ground, cubs and all. How the men gonna nod at me and the ladies curtsey and Missy Green bring me flowers at springtime. And how I’m just gonna smile and flash my yellow eyes and tell ‘em my Ma calls me Sunshine. ‘Cause ain’t none of us meant to travel this life alone. <|endoftext|>

Book Excerpt
Chapter 1
Lea’s lids fluttered open. Silence hung heavy about her. She was faintly aware of 
being afraid, but she couldn’t remember why. It took her a minute to register that 
it was barely dawn, and that she was in a forest with tall trees of deep emerald 
and a cold, sharp wind. It had stopped raining, but not for too long. Her clothes 
were still damp on cool skin.
Light crept across the forest floor and shone through the treetops, 
glittering in between the overhead canopy of leaves like diamonds in a bed of 
emerald velvet. The thought felt fanciful, unlike her… Had she bled out? This 
sense of nothingness must be the touch of death... 
It was the rough gleam of something rippling gently in the distance that 
distracted her. A little lake lay perhaps ten feet away, glancing up at her with a 
pretty, beckoning glitter. Like an old key fitted in a rusty lock, the world jolted 
into place. Bright brown eyes widened. The sharp winds faded into insignificance. 
She’d escaped.
Lea’s lips curved into a shaky smile.
Something occurred to her then. The wolves … they didn’t get me.
Her breath caught. Memories rushed back with shocking suddenness. She 
remembered now why she was afraid and hastily attempted to rise, only to wince 
at the stab of pain that hit her stomach. She fell back down with a thud. Her back 
pressed hard against tree bark, and the dark stain colouring the side of her tunic 
turned ominously darker. Her heart pounded heavily in her chest. It was so cold. 
Soundlessly, Lea let the tears fall.
As though they had been a signal eagerly awaited by the forest, a great 
shivering breath of air raced through the woods. Winds cut cruelly at the small 
figure curled up at the base of her large, gnarled tree. The tree’s dense, green 
canopy provided scant cover from the harsh winds, caressing Lea’s bruised skin 
with fingers as sharp as daggers, chilling her to a remarkable sensation beyond 
numbness. Her tears dried on her cheeks. She began to tremble.
A howl cut through the silence. The sound was high and lingering, 
ominously beautiful as it travelled straight through the air to Lea’s position. 
Hastily, she grasped the crudely fashioned dagger that she’d let fall to the ground 
just by her, then stilled. Her eyes narrowed on the foliage before her. In her 
mind’s eye, she could imagine the glint of intelligent, feral eyes gleaming under 
the gloom of the pale sunlight; shadowed soft grey fur and snapping jaws; a 
growling wolf pack nipping at her heels as her dagger swung desperately –
“Damn it,” Lea whispered, and tensed. Her eyes darted back and forth. 
How much time had passed since she’d fallen? The brightening sunlight took on 
the aspect of a sly trick played by the fates. Oh, to die where none would know – 
Snap.
Every muscle in Lea’s body locked in place. A moment passed, then two.
Snap!
Her world narrowed in on that small, crackling sound of a twig crunched 
underfoot. For a strange moment, it felt like the forest stilled with her.  Lea 
dragged in a small, unsteady breath – no wolf was that careless.
