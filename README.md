Fianl year dissertation project with purpose to solve a research question: “Can machine learning be used to modernize electronic books by connecting text generation and user interactions?”. 

This project focus on implementation of machine learning transformers algorithms to generate a new text from original source. Ma
Project use machine learning models such as GTP-2 and T5 to generate a book like tales/stories.
